In a just society, those who hold power are held accountable for how their choices and the use of power affect the lives of others. <br> <br> <br> <br>Rights of All People  <br>In a more just society, human rights and dignity extend to all people – from those who historically have had power to those most frequently left marginalized at the edges of society.

Empoderamos a las comunidades para que protesten sobre el desarrollo de explotación llevado a cabo sin su consentimiento, y para que protejan la tierra, el agua y los recursos naturales de los que depende su supervivencia. <br>3) <b>Salud y derechos sexuales.</b> Apoyamos a las mujeres, niñas y personas LGBT para que puedan detener la violencia y la discriminación, tener control sobre sus vidas y cuerpos y llevar una vida saludable, segura y digna. <br>4) <b>Poner fin al matrimonio infantil.</b> Buscamos poner fin a la práctica del matrimonio infantil, que cada año viola los derechos humanos de aproximadamente 14 millones de niñas de todo el mundo, para que las niñas puedan determinar su futuro. <br>5) <b>Respuesta a desastres.</b> Cuando ocurren catástrofes graves en los países en los que trabajamos, AJWS proporciona ayuda humanitaria inmediata y mantiene el rumbo con apoyo a largo plazo para su recuperación.
