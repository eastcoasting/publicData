The Huehuetenango department, on which the project's measures are concentrated, is also characterized by an extraordinary wealth of natural and cultural treasures. The last stocks of mountain cloud forest (ecosystem) in Guatemala are in Huehuetenango. However, this biological diversity is increasingly endangered due to the overexploitation of natural resources and the destruction of ecosystems in particular. through deforestation, and the irreversible loss of species threatens (core problem). In its medium-term strategic planning, the project management organization CONAP (Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas) has set itself the goal of In order to fulfill Guatemala's obligations under the Biodiversity Convention, at least 15% of the area of ​​all ecosystems, or the entire area already threatened by habitats (cloud forest, dry forest) at risk of disappearing, must be protected. The aim of the project is to establish a network of communal protected areas to preserve biodiversity and natural resources in the Huehuetenango Department. This is helping to close the gap in underrepresented threatened ecosystems in Guatemala. At the same time, it contributes to the implementation of CONAP's strategic planning. The target group of the project is the predominantly indigenous population of 12 municipalities in Huehuetenango, who belong to the Akateko, Chuj, Mam and Q anjob al peoples. As part of the project, CONAP will establish new protected areas or consolidate existing ones on an area of ​​up to 50,000 hectares. To this end, a system of compensation payments for biodiversity protection is being introduced on a pilot basis in Huehuetenango, which the executing agency will later transfer to all of Guatemala.

At present, due to large-scale deforestation, Indonesia is an significant global emitter of CO2 emissions. To address this problem, the Ministry of Forestry (MoFor) recently initiated an Integrated Watershed Management Programme as a way to integrate land use planning and forest protection in ecological units, even if these units cut across administrative boundaries. The Batanghari Watershed's headwaters rise in the Bukit Barisan mountain chain and mainly spread out through various districts of the province Jambi, Sumatra. The watershed serves as catchment area, providing millions of people living in Southern Sumatra with drinking water. In the upper area of Batanghari Watershed Kerinci Seblat National Park (TNKS) is located. Together with Bukit Barisan Selatan and Gunung Leuser national parks, TNKS forms a World Heritage Site and Tropical Rainforest Heritage. It covers a total area of almost 1.4 million ha of which 436,036 ha (31%) are located at Jambi province, administratively under the districts Kerinci, Merangin, Bungo and Sarolangun. TNKS is characterized by including the only zones of primary forest left in the watershed. In terms of biodiversity TNKS is one of the richest areas in the world with 37 species of mammal, about 400 bird species, 10 species of reptile, 6 species of amphibian and 8 species of primate. The national park is probably last refuge for a.o. Sumatran Tiger, Sumatran Rhinoceros, and Asian Elephant (flagship species). The overall objective of this Programme is to contribute to the implementation of strategies for forest conservation and rehabilitation in order to reduce climate relevant emissions and improve livelihoods of the rural poor. The objective of this Programme (programme goal) is to support Indonesia in strategy development and implementation of measures regarding conservation of biodiversity and watersheds in the framework of the national REDD+- Strategy in West-Jambi (Sumatra). This MoM refer to the project in and around the National Park Kerenci-Seblat in Jambi (thereafter called \"Project\"). The project area comprises selected communes and TNKS areas in the upper (hulu) and middle (tengah) watershed of the Merangin Sub-Sub DAS (MSSD, as sub-sub watershed of Bathangari Watershed) in the districts of Kerenci and Merangin, with the upper watershed (Kerinci and Western Merangin) being the focal area for intervention. Possibly, other adjacent areas with important value for biodiversity (e.g. Sarolangun) might be added, to be defined during the inception phase).

Household access to health and education services is also improved, which especially benefit women. According to updated planning, around 600 km of roads and feeder tracks and associated buildings in production areas need to be rehabilitated and their sustainable operation supported. Appropriate construction works as well as manual maintenance will be carried out, as far as possible, labor intensive with the participation of the local rural population. The total cost of the project is based on the available funds of 35.3 million euros (open program), the contribution of the German CF amounting to a grant of 17.0 million euros (5 million euros of 201 266 980 and 12 million euros in 201 467 356). THE' Agence Française de Développement (AFD) is co-financing the rehabilitation of additional tracks in cotton growing areas within the framework of the \"Mutual Reliance Initiative (RMI)\" with a loan of 10.0 million euros (KfW being the chief in line).

As part of a second phase (\"PRODIA II\"), funds are to be made available to finance economic infrastructure and investment-accompanying measures in a further nine municipalities (autarquias) in the three priority provinces of German development cooperation (Inhambane, Manica and Sofala). This covers all municipalities, including those newly founded in November 2013, in the three priority provinces. The total cost of the project is EUR 25,020,745.51. The aim of the FC measure is the sustainable provision of infrastructure and services for the urban, suburban and rural population of the autarquias. The measures are implemented through national procedures. The population is involved in the selection and planning and uses the infrastructure. The target group of the project is the urban and suburban population of the autarquias as well as those of the surrounding rural areas. In addition to the economically relevant infrastructure, emphasis should be placed on the areas of climate adaptation and urban development (including waste management, energy efficiency and drainage).

However, the potential for sector development is considerably limited by the dilapidated state of rural infrastructure, in particular the rural road network. The measure planned under the joint development cooperation program \"Rural development and agriculture\" improves the connection of rural businesses and households in cotton, coffee and cocoa growing areas with supply and sales markets, which improves their economic performance. Household access to health and education services is also improved, which especially benefit women. According to updated planning, around 600 km of roads and feeder tracks and associated buildings in production areas need to be rehabilitated and their sustainable operation supported. Appropriate construction works as well as manual maintenance will be carried out, as far as possible, labor intensive with the participation of the local rural population. The total cost of the project is based on the available funds of 35.3 million euros (open program), the contribution of the German CF amounting to a grant of 17.0 million euros (5 million euros of 201 266 980 and 12 million euros in 201 467 356).

The objectives of the regional program are to improve peaceful coexistence and the social, political and economic integration of young people in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. As part of the FC measure, investments in youth-specific infrastructure and open space design to create \"safe spaces\" in districts of poor income groups with high violence indices are financed, combined with measures to strengthen the social and professional skills of young people. Both public spaces, which are designed according to the principles of crime prevention and are perceived as safe by the population, as well as youth-specific social facilities, such as youth centers, sports facilities or training centers. The project is designed as an open program. Program interventions will be carried out in 4 cities and there in 4-5 districts. The target group of the program are young people between the ages of 12 and 30 who live in marginalized districts of poor sections of the population with high violence indices and are therefore particularly affected by violence and crime. The borrower is the Republic of Honduras, represented by the Ministry of Finance. The political sponsor of the project is the Ministry of Youth, The Fondo Hondureño de Inversión Social (SEDECOAS-FHIS) is responsible for project management and administrative implementation. The planning and implementation of the infrastructure measures is carried out in self-help by the district communities with the involvement of the target group of young people. The measures to strengthen the social and professional skills of young people are determined in a decentralized, needs-based manner and assigned to local educational institutions for implementation. The total costs amount to around 7.2 million EUR, of which the participating population at the district level and the municipalities each make 0.3 million EUR of their own contributions.

The aim of the project is to achieve significant emission reductions (ER) in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. The funds amounting to EUR 17 million with a EUR 30 million inventory check as well as mandate funds from the United Kingdom (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Energy and Industrial Strategy, BEIS) of up to GBP 23.9 million are to be used to make result-based payments for emissions reductions from the to avoid deforestation. It thus contributes to the overall goal of the REDD Early Movers (REM) program to promote climate protection through forest conservation as REDD interim financing in accordance with UNFCCC specifications. The new FC project is also intended to support the building of bridges between subnational REDD + approaches and an integrated national system. Results-based payments will only be made if the annual deforestation is below the agreed REM performance trigger of 1788 km² (average gross deforestation in the period 2004-2015). This increases the incentive to further reduce deforestation. The module objective is to be remunerated on a results-based basis via the REM program Emission Reductions (ER) from avoided deforestation from 2016 to 2019, with a target volume of around 3.74 million tCO2e (via German funds) or 8.94 million tCO2e (including mandate funds from BEIS). As a personal contribution and risk provision, Mato Grosso decommission at least one additional ton for every tonne of CO2e paid for, which cannot be compensated for otherwise. The funds of the result-based financing (EBF) are reinvested within an agreed distribution system (benefit sharing) and should contribute to the generation of diverse positive development effects. In this way, a contribution is made to the sustainable support of the local population groups living in and from the forest, including indigenous groups, as well as small and medium-sized landowners and thus to the fight against poverty. In addition to supporting indigenous communities, incentives are to be set for sustainable and emission-reduced production in small-scale and medium-sized agriculture. The sponsor is the state government of Mato Grosso, represented by the State Environment Ministry (SEMA). The Brazilian biodiversity fund FUNBIO is proposed as the recipient, who should handle the project financially and administratively. The funds are implemented by state ministries and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in accordance with the agreed benefit sharing system.

The FC program PRODESV II primarily affects Cameroonian cities, which have taken in large numbers of internally displaced persons who were displaced by the conflicts in the Anglophone West. The cities affected are characterized by problems and a lack of resources in dealing with the crisis that has arisen and by the risk of increasing social conflicts between locals and internally displaced persons. The program is also aimed at young people in order to avoid their radicalization and their tendency to migrate to other countries or regions. PRODESV II supports eight selected secondary cities in the West and Littoral regions by building public infrastructure, which is intended both to improve basic communal services and to create employment opportunities. Through the FC project, on the one hand, structural effects are achieved in the supported city administrations - including improved crisis resilience - and, on the other hand, job and income-generating effects. The approach is inclusive (locals and migrants) and conflict preventive. The total cost of the project is EUR 12.64 million. Of the total costs, EUR 9.78 million are due to the financing of PRODESV II (ieS), EUR 2.16 million to top up the medium-sized town program and EUR 0.7 million at the expense of the executing agency. Within the scope of PRODESV II, approx. 6, EUR 88 million earmarked for investment measures. The overall costs are financed by an FC grant of EUR 8.6 million (of which EUR 7.0 million for PRODESV II in the narrow sense and EUR 1.6 million for increasing the medium-sized town program). The Cameroonian state's own contribution - in particular to cover taxes - amounts to EUR 3.01 million, that of the municipalities involved amounts to EUR 0.33 million and that of FEICOM EUR 0.7 million.",

Against this background, the second phase of the module follows on seamlessly from phase I. After the emergency-oriented interventions of the first phase, the objective of Phase II of ECRHS is to provide sustainable support for the epidemiological control system that has been established and to strengthen the efficiency of the health care system with a focus on reproductive health / self-determined family planning. In the central area of epidemic control further promotion of the integrated early warning system for epidemiologically significant diseases is planned, including community-based structures. Furthermore the spread of diseases in health care facilities is to be curbed through improved water supply and sanitation. In the central area of strengthening the health system health care facilities are supported in ensuring basic care for the population with the focus on reproductive health / self-determined family planning. The planning and coordination function of the district management teams is also strengthened through training activities. The target population of the ECRHS is the population of the four rural districts of Bombali, Kambia, Koinadugu and Tonkolili with a focus on particularly vulnerable population groups. At the request of the Sierra Leonean partners the fifth district of Port Loko in the northern province of Sierra Leone will also be included in the second phase: The measures thus focus on the population of five rural districts with a total population of 2.5 million inhabitants, including 630,000 women of childbearing age. The ECRHS conceptually fits into the National Reconstruction Plan for Sierra Leone's Health Sector 2015 - 2020 (Health Sector Recovery Plan) with its five priorities: patients and staff safety, human resource development, promotion of essential health services, information system/surveillance and community participation. The ECRHS will implement activities that contribute to the implementation of all five development priorities of the reconstruction plan.",

            "Description": "Mozambique has several terrestrial and marine natural areas of outstanding global importance. These are divided into absolute protected areas (nature reserves, nature parks as well as cultural and national monuments) and protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources. The protected areas cover approx. 26% of the country's area. The poaching of rhinos and elephants is a big problem. The main obstacles to the sustainable protection of biodiversity are in particular the lack of qualified human resources that would enable adequate management of the protected areas, as well as the lack of long-term and reliable funding, which at least can cover the ongoing costs of managing the protected areas. In response to this problem, the establishment of an environmental foundation has been promoted since 2007 with the involvement of the donor community and the WWF. The main aim of the BIOFUND is to contribute to the sustainable financing of the operating costs (excluding wage costs) of the protected areas. The FC project - here a reserve-checked financing proposal for € 9 million for the third phase - is intended to contribute to the sustainable financing of the mos through the funding of the environmental foundation BIOFUND. National Park System by using interest income from the foundation's assets to cover part of the running costs of protected areas (excluding wage costs). This is to ensure the long-term protection and preservation of marine and terrestrial biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources in the nature reserves of Mozambique. Through the capital increase of the foundation, the coverage ratio of the wage-free operating costs from annual net interest income can be increased, so that the effectiveness, significance and sustainability of the German contribution can be increased. In particular, the people who live near the national parks benefit from their expansion and development through the creation of jobs in park management and in the medium to long term in tourism. Most of the poorest part of Mozambique's population lives in the rural areas around the national parks with an income of less than USD 1.25 per capita per day. In this respect, the measure makes a contribution to poverty reduction by securing the park structures financially. In view of the limited budget of the Mozambican government for the protected area system, the operation of the protected areas will require external support even if the protected area's own income increases in the future. The BIOFUND foundation, organized under private law, is an essential instrument for securing investments in nature conservation in economically weak countries such as Mozambique over the long term. In order to secure the foundation's purpose of the BIOFUND in the long term, the previous donations to the foundation are not yet sufficient. In order to cover the operating costs in the long term, BIOFUND has to acquire new commitments. Another risk is the lack of financial resources for sufficient staff in the protected areas. Since the grants from the BIOFUND are only intended for the labor-free operating costs of the protected areas, the responsibility for paying the salaries lies with the Mozambican government.",

            "Description": "In a global context of persistent racism and racial inequality, alongside the growing \"post-racial\" denial of their importance, this project will explore the role of the arts in challenging racism.  The project aims to investigate the sociality, practices and discourses of contemporary cultural producers working in literature and visual and performing arts who focus on issues of racial difference, racism and anti-racism in three Latin American contexts: Brazil, Colombia and Argentina.  Why the arts? We work on the basis that the arts have always played a crucial role in anti-racist movements, serving as important tools with which to protest against and educate about racism. The arts have the ability to mobilise emotions through narrative and performance, and this makes them well suited to deal with racism's dependence on an emotive logic. By combining expertise from the arts and the social sciences in a cultural studies approach, we seek to locate artistic practices that address racial inequality and racism in their social and cultural context; we aim to map how the producers, their practices and their products circulate in the social world and produce effects there that contribute to the struggle against racism.  While rationally devised social policy addressing socio-economic conditions is vital to correcting racial inequalities, it can simply by-pass, be undermined by and even exacerbate the visceral emotions that racial difference produces in a racially hierarchical society. It is these emotions we seek to approach and address through the medium of art and performance.  Why Latin America? Because the region has a long history in which \"post-raciality\" - by which we mean the tendency to deny or minimise the significance of racism and racial inequality, invoking a colour-blind universalism - has co-existed with marked racial inequality and with often veiled but still powerful racist attitudes. This paradoxical co-existence is becoming characteristic of other areas of the world, in the wake of post-World War II trends that made \"race\" politically toxic and made the denial of racism commonplace, while racial inequalities remain and even grow. We contend that the way struggles against racism in Latin America address this long-standing co-existence can hold lessons for anti-racism more widely. For example, the post-racial claim that increased inter-racial mixture indicates decreasing racism is belied by the fact that Latin American countries have often been majority mestizo (mixed-race) societies for over two centuries, without this having solved the problem of racial inequality and racism.  A notable feature of the project is that it encompasses anti-black and anti-indigenous racism in a region where practices and attitudes prejudicial to indigenous people are often not labelled as racism, but also at a time at which this label is becoming increasingly popular in struggles against such prejudice, highlighting the structural dimensions of indigenous disadvantage. A further strength of the project is its comparative approach, which seeks to use the rather different racial formations of Argentina, Brazil and Colombia to assess how generic or country-specific anti-racism strategies are.   Research teams in each country will bring together senior and junior, UK-based and Latin American researchers in the social sciences and arts to work with a range of artists and performers to explore diverse practices, including for example indigenous literatures, visual arts and cinema in Brazil, hip-hop music in Brazil and Colombia, Afro-Colombian art and an indigenous-black organisation that uses performance as a pedagogical tool, and street dance and commercial music forms alongside literature and political art in Argentina. Project researchers will work closely with artists and performers and will collaborate with them in project workshops, which will also have a public-facing component.",

            "Description": "Several essential oils of high market value are produced naturally by the leaves of various plant species of the genus Mentha, a member of the Lamiaceae (mint) family. In particular, the monoterpenoid menthol, primarily isolated from the peppermint Mentha x piperita, is a commercially important compound for a variety of consumer products in the food and healthcare industries, while the potent insect repellent compound nepetalactone has recently been found to be produced in the pineapple mint Mentha suaveolens in our preliminary studies leading to this proposal. Several Mentha species and varieties are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that commercial cultivation of mints could represent an excellent resource for globally-competitive production of mint essential oils. This project seeks to maximise the production and usage of the essential oils menthol and nepetalactone, involving partnerships between Cardiff (Wales) and Makerere (Uganda) Universities that will enable local rural Ugandan farming communities to cultivate and extract mint essential oils to develop new products for commercial exploitation and benefit the local economy. This project will develop new elite mint varieties for cultivation in Uganda to produce high yields of essential oils containing menthol or nepetalactone. To achieve this aim, we will adopt parallel strategies exploiting natural variation/ diversity within the Mentha genus together with metabolic engineering using established genetic modification technologies, followed by growth trials for cultivation optimisation in Uganda and essential oil extraction using existing local facilities. The following objectives are linked to specific outputs from Work Packages (WPs) detailed in the Case for Support. Objectives: 1) Identification of Mentha varieties with highest levels of menthol or nepetalactone (WP1) - Naturally occurring Mentha varieties will be subjected to biochemical profiling by GC-MS and GC-FID to identify those with the highest levels of menthol or nepetalactone 2) Metabolic engineering of enhanced menthol production in Mentha using genetic modification (WP2) - Mentha lines producing high levels of menthol will be produced by genetic modification using a combination of approaches involving overexpression of geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) and limonene synthase (LimS), and downregulation of menthofuran synthase and the trichome-specific transcription factor MsYABBY5 by RNAi. 3) Assay natural and GM varieties for cultivation suitability in Ugandan conditions and ease of oil extraction by conducting field trials and pilot oil distillation extractions (WP3) - Field trails will be conducted by our partners in Uganda to identify natural Mentha varieties (WP1) best able to grow in Ugandan field conditions. GM lines (WP2) will also be subjected to field trials for performance evaluation. 4) Determine effectiveness of Mentha-derived nepetalactone as a mosquito repellent (WP4) - Mentha suaveolens-derived nepetalactone will be tested for effectiveness in mosquito repellence compared to the commercially available repellent DEET using an olfactometer in accordance with WHO protocols. 5) Knowledge exchange and commercialisation activities with CEMPOP (WP5) - training of Ugandan scientists and farmers and development of products containing menthol or nepetalactone in collaboration with Ugandan academics to benefit local Ugandan rural economy - Creation of community enterprise groups involving local Ugandan farmers and local rural population/ workforce with our partner organisation CEMPOP, who will also devise plans for commercial exploitation via business plans and marketing strategies. Development of food/beverage products containing menthol, and non-food uses of menthol in cosmetic and personal care products.

            "Description": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half of the world's population, with most rice being consumed as polished, white rice. However, the milling process removes many essential nutritional components, including essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc, vitamins, fatty-acids, phytochemicals and dietary fibre. This can lead to the development of micronutrient deficiencies among peoples for whom rice is the primary source of calories. Furthermore, white rice tends to have a high glycaemic index (GI), the starch being rapidly digested in the human intestine. The consumption of high GI and glycaemic load foods, alongside a decrease in physical activity and rapid urbanization, has contributed to the expansion of non-communicable diseases such as type-II diabetes, with the Philippines having the highest recorded levels. Thus, high consumption of white rice presents as a prime example of the double burden of malnutrition.   Rice is very much part of the culture of many peoples, especially in Asia. Therefore a reduction in rice consumption is often not an acceptable option. Old local varieties, including coloured rice (black or purple, red to brown) have been shown to possess higher nutritional value and numerous health benefits, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidaemic properties. Consequently there is growing interest among consumers for health-promoting food products, although this is primarily among higher-income consumers. In 2015 a successful purple rice variety was released in Thailand, RiceBerry. However, RiceBerry is low yielding and is currently directed at a high-income market. There is an urgent need to raise awareness of the value of coloured rice varieties among lower-income consumers, while breeding high-yielding rice varieties with improved nutritional value and low GI, without compromising consumer acceptance. This will benefit the millions of people who depend on rice, improving livelihoods and economies.  Polished white rice is 90% starch, a complex carbohydrate made up of amylose and amylopectin that has a high GI. However, lowering the rate of starch breakdown in the gut (low GI) can lead to starch reaching the large intestine (colon) where it undergoes bacterial degradation (fermentation) in a manor analogous to dietary fibre, with consequential benefits to gut health. Work at IRRI has identified linkages between rice starch breakdown and the polyphenols found in red rice accessions. Kaempferol-derivatives, which act as alpha-amylase inhibitors, have been linked to low starch digestibility, while a red rice haplotype was found to be associated with altered amylose vs amylopectin ratios. While polyphenols are in general considered beneficial to human health, there have been reports that some polyphenols can inhibit iron bioavailability. Beneficial and antagonistic effects have also been associated with dietary fibre, e.g. promoting calcium, but limiting iron uptake. Phytates, which are the primary store of phosphorus in cereal grains, can also interfere with micronutrient bioavailability, binding other micronutrients, including iron and zinc. As monogastric animals lack sufficient amounts of appropriate phytate degrading enzymes, phytate is considered an anti-nutritional, having negative effects on the bioavailability of essential dietary minerals.   Given this complex interplay between polyphenols, micronutrients and phytate, starch and dietary fibre on human health, this project aims to identify rice genotypes where the ratios of each optimise the nutritional and health benefits of rice, while maintaining consumer acceptability. Through the rice breeding programmes at our partner institutes in the Philippines and Thailand we aim to introduce these health benefit characteristics into high-yielding rice varieties. Through engagement with policy makers we aim to promote the uptake of coloured rice varieties by lower-income households in the Philippines and Thailand.",

            "Description": "The Peruvian people suffer from what has been described as a \"double burden\" of malnutrition. This means that they simultaneously experience undernutrition and over-nutrition. Undernutrition includes inadequate intake of vitamins, low height for age, or low weight for height. Over-nutrition is the result of high consumption of unhealthy and processed foods, which are high in fat, sugar and salt, and includes overweight and obesity and other diet-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.   The way that food is produced, sold and consumed in the country (\"the food system\") is a major driver of this problem. While Peru has undertaken some bold actions to address malnutrition over the past two decades most policies have a one-sided focus, targeting either under or over-nutrition and fail to address both aspects. The process of identifying and evaluating policies to address this problem needs to take into account the complex economic, social, and cultural factors that influence food systems.  We will use innovative research methods to identify drivers of the double burden of malnutrition in Peru and potential policy solutions which take these complex factors into account. The specific objectives of this project are: 1. Map the drivers of the food system that contribute to the double burden of malnutrition in three diverse regions in Peru; 2. Identify policies and interventions that would address the double burden of malnutrition through changes in the food system; 3. Quantify the impacts of identified policies and interventions on the double burden of malnutrition; 4. Prioritise identified policies and interventions and actively disseminate recommendations   Our research project is characterised by the active involvement of members of the community throughout all its stages. The projects starts with workshops in three regions of Peru (Lima, Tumbes and Huancavelica) during which our research team will guide small groups of community stakeholders to conceptualise and map the drivers of the food system that contribute to the double burden of malnutrition. Community stakeholders will include lay members of the community, policymakers at local and national government authorities, and academics, with a deep understanding of the community issues and experiences, either as residents or organisers, leaders, and service providers. At the next stages of the project, stakeholders will guide the research team to identify relevant policy options that are appropriate at national and regional level. They will also be consulted throughout the quantitative evaluation of these policies to ensure that it accurately represents stakeholder views as expressed during the workshops. Finally, they will have an active role in prioritising and recommending appropriate policy options, disseminating the results of the project to other members of the community, and acting towards policy change.  Our research project is a collaboration between universities in Peru, the United Kingdom and Brazil. The research team have expertise in policy evaluation, food systems and public heath nutrition, modelling and health economics. The project will strengthen academic collaboration between these institutions and build research capacity in Peru. It will also strengthen collaboration between Peruvian institutions and members of the local community by establishing long-term working relationships between parties.",

            "Description": "The diversity of life in a given area, its biodiversity, is fundamental to the stability and function of the ecosystem within that area, as well as to the services it can provide, including eco-tourism. However, we generally have limited knowledge of the constituents of biodiversity, with implications for our understanding of ecology and evolution, and the implementation of conservation. For example, even for conspicuous animals, such as birds, history has taught us that it is difficult to define a species based on traditional methods of grouping around morphology or song. By revealing hidden variation, molecular genetics has, more recently, exposed hundreds of new species of birds, and there are thought to be hundreds more to be discovered. In addition, molecular methods allow us to detect connectivity between populations, identify sub-species or races and uncover the genetic signature of individuals within a specific area. In turn, these allow us to study speciation in action, recognise threats to population viability, inform captive breeding programmes and even spot individuals that are illegally trafficked or caught. Finally, molecular tools are the fastest method of identifying plankton, the engine of our seas, and are the only viable means of estimating the number and signatures of species at the base of the tree of life (e.g., microbes). We propose to barcode the unique biodiversity of Galapagos, the inspiration for amongst the greatest scientific revolutions in history - Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.   Today, this Natural World Heritage site (est.1976) and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (est.1984) not only continues to help us understand the process of evolution by natural selection, but also inspires pioneering models of sustainability, conservation and ecotourism. Such models are celebrated for their long-term solutions to existing tensions between the preservation of biodiversity and the social-economic well-being of local inhabitants. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed their vulnerability to short-term perturbation. The consequence of this vulnerability is obviously far-reaching for a community wherein 80% are reliant on tourism. This not only means that the biodiversity from which we have learned so much and upon which the Galapagos' relies for its ecotourism industry, is under imminent threat from harvesting, but also that the naturalist guides, who are the 'eyes' of the park and disseminate Darwin's legacy to the 275,000 tourists annually, have lost their income.   Our vision is to train and employ 84 naturalist guides to catalogue the biodiversity of Galapagos, from microbe to mammal, using 21st century genetic barcoding approaches. This 'Barcode of Life' project will ensure that: (1) the genetic profile of Galapagos is documented and curated so that the direct and indirect impacts of environmental perturbations can be quantified; and (2) naturalist guides, who are central to economic recovery for a population almost entirely reliant on ecotourism, receive immediate capacity-building employment. Throughout, we will (3) record the socio-economic consequences of our approach at the level of individuals and the community in order to guide future attempts at using locally-driven research to improve the socio-economic well-being and resilience of key workers in the ecotourism industry. Our project partner, the Galapagos Conservation Trust, will ensure that our initiative is widely publicised and discussed in schools, in the local community and with the numerous stakeholders (including National Parks, Biocontrol Agency, and the numerous NGO's working in the Galapagos). This novel initiative to barcode an ecosystem puts science at the forefront of socio-economic well-being, and acts as an important reminder of the long-term benefits of sustainable natural resources for employment and education.",

            "Description": "There is a long history of disconnection and lack of trust between vulnerable communities (slums and favelas) and public authorities in Brazil, due to diverse reasons, including failures in service delivery (e.g., sanitation, education, health), overuse of violence by the police force, and the presence of militias (parastatal power). Many social interventions for COVID-19 prevention and control require co-operation from citizens to be effective. Local communities and their local leaders know their daily needs, their areas, and the social environment better than the government. To cope with COVID- 19, and similar future crises, members of the vulnerable community need to be engaged as part of the solution, and given voice. Our proposal aims to enact co-production with members of these communities and municipal councils. Such councils are already established all over the country. The project will promote an exercise on co-production to design tactics and solutions to prepare neighborhoods for facing future interventions, and in particular vaccine delivery (SDGs goals 3, 10,11,16). Such co-production space would open up opportunities to share information, give voice to local leaders and community members. It is about increasing resilience, reducing social vulnerability, rebuilding trust, through co-production to cope with pandemic outbreaks. The process includes four stages: (i) identification of \"successful collective strategies\" in vulnerable areas of two Brazilian capital cities (Belem and SÃ£o Paulo), looking at the determinants of such action, by interviews, (ii) extending the understanding through an extensive survey to others communities from the same cities, (iii) developing a mobile application to create a co-production milieu supporting people to jointly act with municipal councils, (iv) rolling out the initiative to others urban areas disseminating the results.",

The project combines research methodologies from psychology, social science, and environmental, structural and infrastructure engineering. This is highly innovative, and reflects the interdisciplinarity needed to aid post-disaster recovery. Resilient recovery requires community and family wellbeing, functioning services and safe structures and it is these that the proposed project addresses. It has the goal of fostering the resilient recovery of the displaced communities in the poorest parts of Palu, where an earthquake and tsunami in September 2018 displaced 164 000 people and damaged/destroyed 12 000 schools. The project aims to develop evidence-based, multi-pronged interventions for fostering resilient recovery in the marginalised, disaster-displaced communities of Palu via school-based hubs.  The overall goal of the proposed project is to assess the psycho-social, environmental (water and sanitation hygiene (WASH)) and physical causes for most children in the marginalised regions of Palu remaining outside of full-time education and to then intervene, at the psycho-social, environmental and physical levels to create a more resilient future for them. The project will achieve this goal through the delivery of the following objectives:  Assessment phase -To gauge pupil, caregiver and teacher priorities in three marginalised communities -To assess the environmental needs and aspirations of local communities concerning access to basic services, such as WASH, to aid resilient recovery processes  -To assess the physical and social impact of earthquakes, tsunami and ground failure on school buildings through purpose-developed fragility and vulnerability models; validating these against observations from the September 2018 Sulawesi event and other recent Indonesian earthquakes Intervention phase -To intervene to increase empowerment of the community and foster resilient recovery via disaster preparedness programs  -To develop a locally appropriate set of interventions for improved access to WASH through engagement with local communities, teachers, contractors and governmental stakeholders -To propose a set of locally appropriate approaches for intervening on both damaged and undamaged schools in Palu, for their improved future disaster resilience. -To disseminate a culture of safer and resilient communities through safer schools by training local engineers  -To develop datasets and practical tools (e.g., mobile app) for multi-hazard risk assessment and resilience enhancement and demonstrate their capabilities in the case-study of Palu Overall -To foster new partnerships between UK and Indonesian researchers and practitioners to investigate equitable resilience challenges and define research and innovation gaps for future joint work  The research aims to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of 'ensuring inclusive and equitable quality educational opportunities for all' (SDG4), 'making human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' (SDG11) and providing access to basic WASH services to all (SDG6). The research findings will be disseminated widely, in academic journals and practice-oriented reports and guidelines. In this way the project aims to influence future recovery assistance delivery by NGOs, who are a further targeted beneficiary. The project looks to provide a legacy in Indonesia beyond the end of the project in the form of 1. An educational curriculum for disaster risk reduction through TDMRC's strategic role as advisor to the Ministry of Education in Indonesia, and 2. A stronger research capacity in the field of disaster risk reduction",

            "Description": "Land degradation is a major problem in Ethiopia. Recent estimates put the size of degraded land in Ethiopia at more than one-quarter of the entire country, which affects nearly a third of the population. Land degradation takes many forms and has many different effects, with the most adverse impacts on poor people, who depend heavily on natural resources. Forests, soils, water, biodiversity, and economic and social services derived from the ecosystems are all affected.  Climate change and extreme weather events, such as the recent El NiÃ±o effect, significantly increase the risk of soil erosion, and losses of soil nutrients.   The impact of degradation and measures to restore land are inherently unequally distributed across the population in time and space. Restoring degraded common lands through the establishment of \"exclosure\" areas where traditional community access is restricted is widely used in Ethiopia. These restrictions particularly affect those without access to other sources of firewood and grazing. Such inequalities and local perceptions of justice need to be taken into account if soil restoration is to be sustainable in the long run.    This project aims to improve the design of measures to combat land degradation while considering equity and justice, strengthening risk management and benefits for communities, particularly poor and marginal groups, increasing the capacity of local people to adapt and improve their lives.     The project draws on an interdisciplinary approach covering anthropology, agricultural and forestry science, economics, environmental modelling, hydrology, sociology, and soil science.  In case study areas within the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region in Ethiopia (SNNPR) covering different agricultural and climatic zones, the project will design interventions with the Ethiopian Bureau of Agriculture to - Train and provide access to exclosures to selected eligible landless youth and women to enable them to undertake new productive activities in 1) beekeeping or 2) livestock management.  - Demonstrate and train local farmers in simple measures to address gully formation  The research aims to find out the impact of the new interventions on the participants, how the interventions were communicated and promoted within the communities, how they were experienced by different groups, and their impact on preferences and attitudes to natural resource management within the community.    The project will collect soil, hydrology and socio-economic data.  This will be used with environmental and economic modelling to measure the impacts of the interventions on the direct participants, and preferences for natural resource management in the wider community, and the potential long-term effects on land degradation, thus helping to improve the design local natural resource management.   With local and regional practitioners, development agents and representatives of local communities, the project will draw together all the results of the research to develop recommendations for improving frameworks to planning land degradation measures aligned to communities' aspirations, values and notions of justice.",

            "Description": "The proposed project's objectives were co-developed with our colleagues in three major Brazilian universities, the Brazilian regulator for mining, the regulator for the oil and gas industry, the association of risk and reliability assessors in Brazil, and a leading think tank in Latin America.  In increasing order of priority, the objectives of the project are to 1. Develop and validate near-real time monitoring tools to identify dam structural performance under changing conditions and quantify the relative likelihoods of dam failures with sound scientific methods;  2. Develop and validate software tools to quantify the impact of tailings dam failure along all dimensions of exposure including the immediate threat to life, long-term human health, and environmental damage; 3. Engage with Brazilian regulatory authorities to implement and deploy these tools on their data collection platform. The tools will support planning and regulatory actions based on ranked risks to humans and local environments from mine tailings dams, and enhance the capacity of the regulator to scrutinise mine operations with independent analysis; 4. Facilitate multistakeholder governance of mine tailings storage by organising collaborations and making the results of the scientific risk analyses accessible to all stakeholders, focusing on the marginalised and at-risk, leading to a social licence for mining operations (UNEP 2017; Golder 2016); and, most importantly, 5. Helping to empower at-risk communities to actively engage with the risk-reduction agenda by enhancing transparency to recognise their own risks, reducing information asymmetry, and identifying and tackling the social, cultural, organizational, and individual factors hampering on-site/at-work risk awareness, and understanding the perspectives of different stakeholders (Migueles 2007; Bowker 2011). These objectives support the project's greater goals to A. Reduce the severity of disasters through cooperation to strengthen disaster risk planning and preparedness, accounting for specific local characteristics with site-specific scientific modeling using local geographic and demographic data, B. Facilitate shared responsibilities between national authorities, operators and other stakeholders to support inclusive decision making and empower local communities with accessible science and decision-making responsibilities, and C. Gather an evidence base about the efficacy of the multistakeholder governance approach to resolving a regulatory crisis, and the use of science in shared decision making and disaster planning. The project is aligned with the Sendai framework (UNISDR 2015) and addresses all four of its priority areas. Objective 1 and especially objective 2 seek to improve \"understanding of disaster risks\" (Sendai priority 1) at mining sites in Brazil in all dimensions of vulnerability of people, assets and the environment for risk assessment, prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response. Through objective 3 this research will enact policy, and objective 4 will create a partnership in the multistakeholder scheme to address Sendai priority 2, to \"strengthen disaster risk governance\" by fostering collaboration and equitable partnerships. The proposed GCRF project is a significant \"investment in disaster risk reduction for resilience\" (priority 3), which is augmented by investments from the Brazilian regulators ANM, ANP, the Brazilian university PUC-Rio, and the University of Liverpool, which together are financially supporting five PhDs aligned to the project. This proposal is in response to the recent dreadful disaster and the shift in public sentiment in Brazil. Now is an opportune time for GCRF funding to \"enhance disaster preparedness and build back better\" (priority 4). Brazil is in a \"reconstruction phase [after these disasters; this] is a critical opportunity to build back better\", creating infrastructure that will help to reduce the severity and prevent disasters in future.",

            "Description": "Good care, nutrition and opportunities to learn during first three years of life are crucial for children's mental, physical and emotional development. One in four children in the world at risk of not developing to their full potential live in India. Among them, children living in rural areas and those from indigenous (tribal) families are at greatest risk, because they are the poorest.  Creches and parenting groups for children under three and their caregivers are possible strategies to help children get the nutrition, care and stimulation they need in early life. Unfortunately, there is little research on whether, how, and at what cost creches and groups could benefit children's development in rural areas with a large number of indigenous families. We have identified a new source of government funding for creches and groups in Indian states with large indigenous communities; these are called District Mineral Foundations. Funds from District Mineral Foundations are meant to benefit communities affected by mining in 12 states, half of which have large rural and indigenous communities. Funds from District Mineral Foundations could be used to finance creches and groups if our research shows they have benefit for children's development.  In this study, we will adapt an existing model of creches fundable by District Mineral Foundations to make it acceptable to rural, indigenous communities of Jharkhand and Odisha, two states of eastern India where over half of indigenous children are chronically undernourished. We will also adapt a successful model of parenting groups tested in Jamaica and Bangladesh for these same rural, indigenous communities in Jharkhand and Odisha. There are very few tools to measure child development adapted for work with indigenous Indian communities, so we will translate and modify six tools to be able to capture changes in caregivers' knowledge about child development, their interactions with children, and children's own development. Finally, we will test whether creches, either on their own or together with groups can improve the development of children in 60 villages of West Singhbhum and Keonjhar districts, in Jharkhand and Odisha. Twenty of these villages will have creches only, 20 will have creches and groups, and 20 will have normal services provided by government. We will compare the mental, physical and emotional development of children aged two years across these three groups of villages after the interventions.  Throughout the research project, we will engage with advocates for creches and parenting groups at regional and national levels through an existing advocacy network and our own government contacts gained through 10 years of scaling up group interventions in different Indian states. We will aim to increase the number of creches and groups funded by District Mineral Foundations in rural areas of five Indian states with large indigenous communities (Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh), and where the project's research partners already work.",

            "Description": "The aim of our project is to identify and implement a contextually designed, community-based educational meta-intervention to impact risk factors associated with maternal mortality in remote communities of Myanmar. This includes identifying the critical factors which influence maternal health and mortality and including key common and unique cultural and contextual components within the education, tailoring the meta-intervention and associated toolkits to each region to increase the effect. Each objective has been incorporated into work packages to address identified development challenges. Management and implementation will be co-led by co-investigators and partners in each region.  1) Explore and develop culturally relevant approaches to partnership at national, regional and community levels. Further objectives include the development of a work package (1) for project management and implementation which will include strategies to develop effective contextual equitable partnership approaches across the regions, liaison and communication methods and a robust system to implement and deliver the aims and objectives of the project.  2) Build community capacity to address health and socio-economic challenges influencing maternal health. Building community capacity is critical to sustainable change in socio-economic and health related development challenges. This will be achieved through work packages 2, 3 and 4 (see case for support). Each work package includes regional and local partners who will co-develop and lead the research and interventions. Stakeholders, beneficiaries and communities to be be included at each stage of the project and resources will be co-developed during each phase to build community capacity to meet the challenges identified.  3) Analyse cultural and contextual factors influencing education and maternal health within ethnic groups in remote and post conflict regions. Further objectives include data collection for each intervention through work packages 2, 3 & 4 to identify the key influencing contextual and cultural factors related to maternal health. Following analysis common beneficial customs will be included into educational interventions and toolkits. Unique components to each region will then also be identified and included to increase relevancy of the knowledge and make it culturally and contextually appropriate.  4) Co-design and evaluate innovative and culturally relevant educational initiatives to address development challenges with regional and local communities. Each intervention design will be mapped to identified development challenges affecting each region and evidence-based strategies will be incorporated into the educational interventions to address these through work packages 2, 3 & 4. This will include research methodologies, guidelines, research tools and educational resources. Evaluation will be completed through a pre-and post-test step wedged design.  5) Identify and include common and unique cultural components to inform the design and equality screen the proposed interventions. Based on previous work from our team at Ulster University we have identified the importance of cultural and contextual information to increase motivational content of education and facilitate behaviour change. In this project our objective is to integrate these unique components into each educational intervention through the co-design process with our local partners and beneficiaries. Each intervention will then be screened to ensure equity of access, understanding and relevancy across the ethnic groups. 6) Develop and test a contextually adaptable holistic maternal health education model. This project will be guided through the implementation of two key theoretical models. However, due to the complexity of the influences and barriers a maternal health education model will co-developed to include the multiple layers of influence with a focus on fragile and conflict states.",

            "Description": "Our main aims are: Aim 1. To examine the epidemiology and patterns of violence exposure in early adolescence.  Quantitatively we will document patterns of self-reported exposure to violence over time, combining information on physical, sexual and emotional violence and neglect, timing, frequency, severity and perpetrator, and the 'normative nature' of the violence. Qualitatively we will explore how young people understand and interpret different forms and patterns of violence exposure, and what they perceive to be 'violence'. Our hypotheses for quantitative analyses are: 1.1 There will be an underlying patterning of violence exposure at Waves 1, 2 and 3 1.2 The patterns/groupings observed in Wave 1 will persist at Wave 2 and Wave 3 Aim 2 (Main aim for quantitative study). To understand which patterns of early adolescent exposure to violence are associated with violence use and experience in later adolescence and young adulthood. We will explore the magnitude of the association between different patterns of early adolescent violence exposure and late adolescent and early adult outcomes. Qualitatively, we will explore how young people's subjectivities, including their values, beliefs and practices, shape their responses to and are shaped by earlier experiences of different patterns of violence. Our hypothesis for quantitative analysis is: 2.1 The likelihood of use and experience of intimate partner violence at Wave 3 will differ by Wave 1 violence exposure group Aim 3. To explore the pathways by which violence in early adolescence, later adolescence and young adulthood are associated, and how context encourages or interrupts these associations. Quantitatively, we will explore whether exposure to specific individual and contextual factors mediate or moderate the relationship between early exposures and later use and experience of violence. Qualitatively, we aim to explore how family, peer and intimate partner relationships influence young people's responses to violence over time, including their capacity to stay safe and to sustain equitable beliefs. We will examine how school systems, practices and relationships influence girls' and boys' capacity to build or maintain anti-violence norms and practices over time, and how transitions to secondary school or out of school influence these processes. We will explore how community structures, norms and relationships, including religious and community justice systems, local provision of services, community organisations and access to media influence girls' and boys' perspectives and practices regarding violence. We will consider how the political economy of the macro-level context influences these processes. Our hypotheses for quantitative analysis are: 3.1 Being male or female will moderate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience  3.2 Whether Wave 1 violence exposure is considered socially normative will moderate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience  3.3 Mental health status at Wave 2 will mediate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience 3.4 Having a family with no violence between caregivers and no caregiver mental health issues at Wave 2 will mediate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience  3.5 Being more exposed to the Good School Toolkit will mediate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience  3.6 Staying in school will mediate the association between Wave 1 violence exposure and Wave 3 intimate partner violence use and experience We plan to explore other factors which may affect the relationship between early adolescent violence exposures and and later outcomes, using an ecosocial approach (these are outlined in Figure 2 of our Case for Support)",

Akiira is determined that their investment in the region should have a positive impact on the local communities in terms of local participation and job creation during the construction and operational phase. At the moment, it is difficult for Akiira to hire local labor, for other than simple jobs such as drivers, guards, etc., due to lack of education and other skills among the local population.\r\n \r\nDue to the discrepancy between the private sector needs of employable labor and the local population's lack of matching knowledge and skills, Akiira Geothermal Ltd and Sida, represented by the Swedish Embassy in Nairobi, initiated a partnership to address some of the development challenges in the region, such as poverty, dismissal, lack of employability, gender inequality and lack of fundamental rights to public services. The model of the partnership is a Public Private Development Partnership (PPDP) with the International Labor Organization (ILO) as coordinator, implementer and agreement partner of the program. Forum Syd will also play a key role in the implementation of the program. In addition, a larger number of partners will also participate and contribute to the jointly set goals of the partnership.

In order to meet the above-mentioned developmental needs of the local population, businesses and governmental functions in the area, the overall purpose of PPDPs is to reduce poverty and improve living conditions through the creation of decent jobs (formal and informal) and to strengthen the capacity of the population to access their rights to public and social services. This will be achieved through three main goals, (1) Decent jobs as a result of improved formal skills and skills through vocational education, (2) Decent jobs, new and growing companies as a result of increased knowledge, business development and access to finance, and (3) The population has the knowledge and capacity to demand public and social services such as water, education, health and sanitation.

            "Description": "The overall objective of this contribution is to improve resilience against climate shocks and promote self-resilience amongst vulnerable groups. This through establishment of income-generating livelihoods specifically for refugee and host societies, decrease cost of humanitarian aid over time and bridging the gap between humanitarian work and development. The goal is to implement this with sustainable and innovative solutions.\r\n\r\nThe innovative in this context is to allow a humanitarian actor such as WFP (World Food\r\nProgram, which has the dual mandate to also work on development), to partner with organizations that specialize in agriculture, livelihoods and market development.\r\nA major part of the contribution will target people in refugee camps in the Dollo Ado area in the southern Somali region. This is an area that is currently receiving humanitarian aid, and the goal is to lift the people living there into a situation that enables sustainable development. The contribution will both target refugee and host communities. \r\n\r\nThe Livelihood efforts will focus on access to water and improved agriculture through irrigation. Access to markets and financial tools will be an integral part of the livelihood development.\r\nThe contribution in Dollo Ado will begin with and inception phase with a thorough feasibility study of livelihood options, an assessment of environmental impact and market analysis.  \r\nOn top of this resilience will be built by improving early warning and response systems for drought and provide an innovative insurance system that will protect current assets as well as provide reimbursement when assets are lost because of drought.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the contribution aims to strengthen the capacity of public, national and local institutions to better resist recurrent drought and disasters. It is primarily the Ethiopian transport sector that will be strengthened by training of drivers and enhanced capacity whit disaster management.\r\nThe main Implementation partner is WFP, in collaboration with Farm Africa and Mercy Corps. The agreed amount contributiong to the effort is initially 79 500 000 SEK up to 2021.\r\n\r\nThe agreement period is from signature in December 2017 to 30  June 2022. The activity period is from signature in December 2017 to 31 December 2021. The first disbursement is in December 2017. An inception phase will begin in January 2018 and focus on the livelihood developments in the Dollo Ado region, which will be finalized by a report submitted no later than August 15 2018.",

The target areas for the contribution are El Golid locality (population 80,000) in Northern State, Shendi locality (population 316,382) in the River Nile State and Telkouk locality (population 271,000) in Kassala State. These have been selected based, on among others, the current level of degradation of natural resources and presences of other programmes/initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe primary target groups in the communities are community volunteers working with/on natural resource management, para-agriculture/forest extension services, organic farming, para-vet extension services, water committees and income generation activities. The communities are both primary target groups and key stakeholders in the implementation of the contribution. Communities will be actively engaged in the design, planning, and implementation of the activities, through the system of community volunteers. Other important actors are local authorities. At state and national level, the primary target group is Sudanese Red Crescent Society staff and volunteer leaders as well as stakeholders such as other CSOs (environment organisation and Women Union) and national authorities. \r\n\r\nPARTNER ORGANISATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT\r\nNetherlands Red Cross (NLRC) is the lead applicant and has the responsibility for overall project management (including quality assurance of implementation, monitoring, financial management, and submission of narrative and financial reporting to the EU). Swedish Red Cross (SRC), Danish Red Cross (DRC) and Spanish Red Cross (SpRC) are co-applicants. Swedish Red Cross is the Swedish applicant organisation for this project application to Forum Syd. Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS) is involved in the entire action as the key implementing partner.\r\n\r\nOVERAL OBJECTIVE AND EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThe overall objective of the project is to contribute to the strengthening of local communities' resilience and sustainable livelihoods to better respond to and cope with climate change. It specifically aims at contributing to the communities' ability in the three localities in Northern- River Nile- and Kassala States to successfully prevent, combat and reverse desertification through improved and sustainable management of natural resources. \r\n\r\nExpected result 1: \r\nSelected localities and communities in Northern-, River Nile- and Kassala State have increased ability to rehabilitate, protect and sustainably manage forest, farmland and rangeland and react to early warnings. \r\n\r\nExpected result 2: \r\nSelected localities and communities in Northern-, River Nile- and Kassala State have adopted improved coping strategies that suit the current and future climate and available natural resources. \r\n\r\nExpected result 3: \r\nSelected localities and communities in Northern-, River Nile- and Kassala States have adopted improved renewable energy practices that suit the current climate changes and available resources.",

The reason behind the Access to Health fund is prioritizing services in these areas is because access to health services are extremely low. By focusing on these areas, the Fund will be targeting some of Myanmarâ€™s least equitable access-to-health situations and some of the countryâ€™s most vulnerable groups, in places that the government often is not able to reach and support. Universal Health Coverage, the country's goal for 2030, requires access to health for populations throughout the country, and can only be achieved through closer cooperation and coordination with EHOs and their partners as well as ensuring referrals within the overall health system. The recent participation of EHOs in the definition of the National Health Plan, and their explicit responsibility in the delivery of the plan, are indications on the role that these organisations can play. The Fund will continue to promote and support such participation.Â \r\nIn the design of the program of the Access to Health Fund, an analysis at the State level, combined with stakeholder consultations (with MoHS, implementing partners, EHOs) has been carried out and will continue. The analysis aims to gage the specific and diverse population needs in program geographies, and to identify appropriate and effective interventions to deliver the outcomes. The program indicators will be revised in line with forthcoming discussions.

            "Description": "The aim of the project \"Sustainable Integrated Development Approach\"Â isÂ to strengthen the resilience of people living in Darfur (North,South and West) and Gedaref states. These areas are water catchment areas that have been identified as especially needy in terms of water scarcity but with potential to improve because of these being water \"gathering\" areas (where water flows into a \"catchment\" area). The selected states also corresponds to Sida's/OCHA's analysis of areas most vulnerable/at risk.\r\nCommunity participation committees will be used to manage the scarce natural resources (such as water) to avoidÂ conflicts. Through Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) the program aims to create a well-reasoned balancing of water needs with water availability and to improve communities planning and management of water usage for specific areas, communities, including both pastoralists and farmers in this planning and management process. The same approach will be used for managing local forests as a source of firewood.Â \r\nThe project hasÂ four outcomes: 1) Improved conditions for peaceful and inclusive societies at the local level, including land rights; 2) Increased sustainable management of water resources, and increased access to water; 3) Increased capacity on local levels toÂ sustainably manage and protect natural resources and prevent environmental degradation, and 4) Increased sustainable agricultural productivity and improved food security.\r\nActivity summaryOutcome 1:- Capacity building of local organisations and committees on conflict resolution and building of trust- Strengthen land right systems at Locality level- Capacitate local organisation and committees on resolving issues related to land rights\r\nOutcome 2:- Establishment and training of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Committees in targeted catchment areas- Development of Water Resources Management Plans (WRMPs)- Construction of groundwater recharge infrastructure- Rehabilitation and/or construction of water supply infrastructure for people, livestock and crops\r\nOutcome 3:- Strengthen the capacity of local committees to manage natural resources- Improve corridor management- Increase the understanding of local communities on environmental degradation- Pilot environmental friendly alternatives for cooking and lighting on community level (this includes the provision of income generating activities (IGAs) for women)- Set up of tree seedling nurseries\r\nOutcome 4:- Set up of farmer field schools- Stimulate diversified crop production (including irrigated systems)- Set up of seed banks- Distribution of intermediary technology equipment to farmers groups- Organize farmers in associations and connect them to the private sector and other relevant bodies (microfinance, insurance, government entities)\r\nIn regards to reporting, the baseline in any new geographical area cannot be done until permission to work in the areas is obtained from HAC, the Sudanese Humanitarian Aid Commission. This can only be applied for once there is an agreement in place. Baseline from the geographical areas where the partners have been working already exists, which in some cases is close the to proposed sites for this intervention.\r\nAnchoring their work with local governments will beÂ very important for the success and eventual sustainability of the project.\r\nDialogue questions to follow up on during review meetings, field visits, etc:Â - Outcome 1: Regarding Land Rights, a possible contact with various actors working in this area such as Swedish Land Survey (LantmÃ¤teriet) andÂ UN-Habitat in Sudan. Explore the possibility to include Sudan in an upcoming ITP programme under CAPDEV strategy.Â - Outcome 2 and 4Â - water harvesting infrastructure should be of interest and there are good examples (successful low-tech infrastructure) to learn from.- For output 3.3 ZOA should develop an e-waste management strategy if the proposed feasibility study on use of domestic solar is put into practice- Close follow-up on the fuel efficient stoves is recommended- Explore the possibility with ZOA to base their indicators on SDG targets (1,2,5,6,13 and 16)- Follow how they build on humanitarian work/resilence.\r\nOverall a very ambitious, comprehensive and well-thought through multi-sectoral project with a needs-based and community-driven program approach. Aside from the dialogue questions which require more consistent follow-up, several aspects of the program need to be further developed during the inception phase and again reviewed by experts at Sida (See comments from Plan Appraisal meeting 2018-09-04). The Inception Phase which will end by 30 April 2019, will provide Sida with an updated budget and log frame.\r\nSida assesses that during the Inception phase, the Consortium has a good possibility of setting realistic and attainable objectives. Documentation and information from other programs carried out by ZOA and their partners indicate a high level of confidence in their work and a good level of achievement.",

This specific objective seeks to strengthen womenâ€™s capacity, build confidence and self-esteem.\r\nSO 2 (relational sphere): To address institutional barriers that limit womenâ€™s economic advancement in agricultural value and market chains. This sphere relates to the attitudes and norms of people within womenâ€™s lives and the enterprises women may interact with. The objective will work to transform norms, attitudes and values of men, while at the same time support women to develop sustainable and resilient techniques that mitigate the impacts of climate change.Â \r\nSO 3 (social sphere): To strengthen womenâ€™s voice and collective power at community level to increase access to, control and ownership of productive (e.g. physical assets, land) and financial assets among women through women-led local organisations, land tenure and financial inclusion. This objective will seek to support the establishment of women-led local organisations, as well as ensuring that women have more access to financial services including insurance and saving groups.

            "Description": "Zambia is one of the youngest countries in Africa, with a youth population (15 to 35 years old) of 4.8 million (36.7% of the total population). In the economy, now in crisis, but even in years of economic growth, the participation is very unequal and poverty levels are high and employment creation low. Unemployment is one of the most pressing challenges for Zambian youth. Therefore, the Zambian government has set the goal of creating a million jobs over the next five years in key sectors in its 7th National Development Plan 2017-2021. Next to agriculture, the extractive and transport industries are the biggest employers. Zambia, a commodity-based landlocked economy, moves its extractive industry input and minerals output by road to the seaports of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Durban, South Africa.\r\nIn the past twenty years, the production of copper has increased significantly. Even though the industry have faced and is facing fluctuating prices and other challenges Zambia's mining industry has gained macroeconomic significance.\r\nAlthough railway infrastructure is available, it needs substantial investment to comepte with the road connectivity available to all seven bordering countries. In order to support the government initiatives to bolster youth employment in key sectors, this project will enhance the transport and heavy equipment sector by fostering systemic change in the development of a skilled workforce.\r\nThe majority of the current workforce acquires their skills through vocational institutions accredited by the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority Zambia (TEVETA). Due to the unavailability of industry linkages and funding constraints, most of these vocational institutions lack the appropriate infrastructure and modern equipment to provide their students with market relevant competencies. Because of this, even the graduates of these institutions are unable to find suitable employment, or, even if they do find work, have difficulty performing and retaining their jobs. The labour market operates with a sizeable expatriate workforce to fill this skills shortage, which affects the private sector bottom-line earnings because of the higher wage requirements of expatriate workers.\r\nThis project aims to boost the capacity of a major vocational institution through a multilateral public-private partnership programme to decrease the skills shortage in transport truck sector.\r\nThe overall objective of the project is to enhance youth employability in the transport and heavy duty equipment sector in Zambia.\r\nThe outcome of the project is to provide effective and relevant industrial skills training to young Zambians; and help them transition into gainful employment by becoming more skilled, and therefore more employable.\r\nThe following outputs and activities will take place under the proposed project:\r\nOutput 1: Gap between employersâ€™ expectations and current educational standards for the transport and heavy equipment sector bridged through the development of a competency-based qualification framework and modern curriculum\r\nActivity 1.1 Conduct a survey to determine curriculum input and labour data;\r\nActivity 1.2 Develop a competency-based curriculum;\r\nActivity 1.3 Validate the curriculum;\r\nActivity 1.4 Obtain national accreditation for the new curriculum through TEVETA;\r\nÂ \r\nOutput 2: Regional centre of excellence created by improving NORTECâ€™s institutional capacity through the provision of modern equipment and Training of Trainers (ToT) as well as scaling up across Zambia through the provision of relevant equipment and technology transfer trainings \r\nActivity 2.1 Upgrade existing NORTEC training facilities in the automotive department by procuring and installing modern equipment\r\nActivity 2.2 Manufacture fixtures and accessories to handle the training equipment/ machinery/tools according to safe work practices;\r\nActivity 2.3 Develop a staff development plan for conducting skills upgrading for all trainers in teaching methodologies and technical skills, including gender-sensitive approaches;\r\nActivity 2.4 Provide trainers with technical and pedagogical skills necessary to deliver upgraded and new training curriculum (incl. e-Learning);Â \r\nActivity 2.5 Identify VTCs across Zambia for knowledge-sharing and relevant technology transfer programme;\r\nActivity 2.6 Determine relevant equipment, logistical support and budget for effective technology transfer;\r\nActivity 2.7 Commission and deliver the relevant equipment and technology;\r\nActivity 2.8 Deliver technology transfer sessions for other VTCs to equip trainers with technical and pedagogical skills necessary to deliver upgraded and new training curriculum\r\nÂ \r\nOutput 3: Training and career services provided to 450 young Zambians, with a particular focus on female and disadvantaged students\r\nActivity 3.1 Provide 450 young men and women with training programmes for the transport sector work force;\r\nActivity 3.2 Promote gender equality through the dedicated and targeted actions to increase the enrolment of female students in a traditionally male-dominated industry;Â \r\nActivity 3.3 Provide bursaries for vulnerable and underprivileged youth across Zambia to increase their participation in the training activities;Â \r\nActivity 3.4 Establish a career services centre at NORTEC to help institute industry linkages to technical and soft-skills training and arrange professional and relevant internships for trainees;\r\nActivity 3.5 Establish a performance management system to collect feedback from trainees doing company internships, from recent graduates as they transition into the workforce, and from employers hiring students, to ensure that the traineesâ€™ qualification meets companiesâ€™ needs.",

PaFF III is well positioned to promote and develop innovative sustainable financing instruments and to promote human rights at the grassroots level by capacity development and policy advocacy targeting the revision on laws on Forestry and Fishery and community Networks.\r\nImpact:Rural and indigenous communities and households are empowered to manage and protect their natural resources and secure their economic, social and cultural human rights by accessing long-term funding opportunities that contribute to sustained livelihoods and improved resilience to natural shocks\r\nOutcome 1:Target communities have dedicated investments and strengthened capacity in order to exercise their secured rights and manage their natural resources sustainably in an inclusive and participatory manner\r\nOutcome 2:Policy and regulatory processes and platforms for sustainable natural resource management and financing mechanisms, with participation of indigenous peoples and local communities, are supported and promoted.\r\nSupport will be provided to 77 community based organisations in four provinces (Kampong Thom, Kratie, Stung Treng, Preah Vihear) that are managing a total of 92 680 Ha. The community based organisations have a membership of almost 40 000 persons and benefit approximately 15 000 families. At the end of the 2 year programme the CBOs will have legally recognized land rights (tenure), approved management plans and increased management capacity.

The OHCHR want to through its work in Cambodia improve UNÂ´s prevention and early warning system and integrate a prevention agenda in UNÂ´s development framework to improve the respect for human rigths and the achievementÂ of the SDGs for Cambodia. The aim is to make Cambodia more resilient to crisis and make international development efforts more cost-efficient, save lives and safeguard development risks.\r\nEven though there has been nearly a six-fold increase in per capita income over the last decade, several people remain particularly vulnerable due to structural inequalities and discrimination. Statistic shows that 13.5 percent of the population is poor and 28 percent of the people that is near-poor; thus 42,5 percent of the population is multi-dimensionally poor; and the urban poor, i.e. the large proportion of migrant workers and workers in the informal sector living in informal settlements mainly located in the peri-urban outskirts of cities. These figures and facts show the complexity of the vulnerability of the marginalised people in Cambodia. Access to information on the actual situation for different groups is not easy to access which is something OHCHR together with other UN agencies, state institutions and local NGOs are working on to improve.Â \r\nThe intervention is focusing on the most disadvantaged groups facing high insecurities in their daily lives. These are the informal and migrant workers; indigenous communities and other ethnic minorities; persons with disabilities; LGBTI persons, youth, and elderly persons. Within all population in disadvantage or vulnerable situations referredÂ to above women and girls are particularly marginalizedÂ - also evident in the Gender Inequality Index valueÂ where Cambodia rank 114 out of 162 countries.Â \r\nThe objective of the program is to strengthenÂ the capacity of duty bearers and voice bearers to promote and protect the human rights of the right holders - particularly the above identified groups that are most vulnerable and exposed in Cambodia.",

            "Description": "The objectives and expected results of the O Waste Programme have not changed; however, the logical framework has been optimized according to the main results of the inception phase.\r\nÂ \r\nThe main objective continues to be the same. To generate integrated solid waste management models emphasizing the reuse of waste under a circular economy approach. These models will prioritize the efficient use of waste to advance into â€œa 0 Garbage approachâ€, promoting the use for organic and inorganic waste in the municipalities. At the end of the project, it is expected to have three models of comprehensive solid waste management validated for different contexts:\r\n- large urban cities, intermediate urban cities and small associated municipalities (â€œciudades mancomunadasâ€)Â \r\n- Three different ecological floor -Altiplano, valleys and lowlands.\r\nÂ \r\nTo achieve the purpose of the project, the fourth initial components/effects that have been established in the original project document remain the same: i) Effect 1: Collection, transport and final disposal; ii) Effect 2: Reuse and commercialization; iii) Effect 3: Institutional development; Iv) Effect 4. Communication, knowledge management and skills.\r\nÂ \r\nThe final target of the programme is to improve the health of the population of the selected municipalities, reducing the levels of environmental pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases.\r\nÂ \r\nThe beneficiary population in the improvement of solid waste management services will be the totality of users: La Paz, 943,758 inhabitants (GAMLP) (a large municipality); Tarija, 245,000 (an intermediate municipality) and its adjoining areas (Uriondo and Villa San Lorenzo); Chaco CruceÃ±o, 65,000 inhabitant (five municipalities, one with a population of intermediate size and four smaller populations). In total, it is a target population of 1,254,000 inhabitants and nine municipalities.\r\nÂ \r\nOf this target population, the work will involve:\r\n- Women, due to the low recognition of them as actors in the solid waste management chain, who, since they do not have basic services, are the most affected as they are usually responsible for taking care of the home (reproductive role, includes hygiene, management waste and household health).\r\n- People/ families dedicated to the classification and collection of waste,\r\n- Population of peripheral areas that suffer irregularly access to the waste management services, with poor quality in their provision.\r\n- Cleaning staff due to their proximity to sources of contamination and because they suffer discrimination from the rest of the population.\r\n- General population, whose perception is negative regarding waste collection and use services.\r\nÂ \r\nRegarding the specific targets established in the logical framework, the programme wants \"to improve the health of the population of the selected municipalities, reducing the levels of environmental contamination\". In this sense and in order to make visible the impact of the proposed objective, it is expected:\r\n- To increase the householdâ€™s perception of improvement in health due to less contamination in final disposal sites (it is expected that the bad perception of contamination will lower from 96% according to the baseline to 80%)\r\n- To reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The aim of this intervention is to reduce emissions by approximately 20% according to the baseline of 270.241,00 Tn CO2-eq/year by optimizing the solid waste collection, use and final disposal systems.\r\n- The improvement of the Environmental Quality Index (ICA) in solid waste final disposal sites (the ICA reduce for La Paz in Air: reduction of at least 10%; Tarija: Air: reduction of at least 10%, and for the Chaco CruceÃ±o: Air: reduction of at least 5% in relation to the baseline).\r\nÂ \r\nFinally, it is important to mention that this contribution has also national importance, especiall considering that:\r\n- Â it wants to promote the generation of integrated solid waste management models (with norms andÂ regulations)Â that could beÂ implemented nationwide. The main expectation will be to lay the foundations to replicate this integral solid waste management models of for the large municipalities (4 existing ones), intermediate cities (35) and in more than 100 smaller urban populations from the country. Together, these populations concentrate 70% of the national population, just over seven million inhabitants).\r\n- as a mechanism to prevent pollutionÂ than can beÂ spread beyond the selected municipalities, considering the potential replicabilityÂ of this 3 models.",

The packages largely aim at reducing food insecurity from an agricultural perspective but also addresses livelihoods, nutritional needs, gender issues and social cohesion aspects.\r\nThe global objective is the revival of sustainable agriculture, essential to reduce poverty, to ensure food and nutritional security for the populations of 99 villages of Lupatapata (in the Mukumbi health zone) and to generate sustainable jobs and income. More specifically, three major priority areas have been identified:\r\nCommunities are equipped to maintain social cohesion. (ii) Communities adopt improved nutritional practices and produce more food for consumption and sale. (iii) 99 villages prioritize gender inclusion at community and household level.\r\nThe activities (i) will help the communities to establish or reactivate their Community Animation Cell, to develop a set of key village development plans and to connect the communities to the main government services and structures. These activities will provide the foundations for villages and their members to describe and implement a shared vision for their village and establish renewed and strengthened relationships with key local government stakeholders.\r\nHouseholds adopt improved agricultural practices to increase production. The project will support smallholder farmers in each village to organize themselves into PO (producer organisation) using training on the CRS SMART Skills curriculum.Â  SMART Skills teach farmers a range of skills to improve their livelihoods, including how to organize into groups, use natural resources sustainably, market produce profitably, manage finances, and save money and organize credit, all while identifying, testing and adopting innovations. SMART Skills enables farmers to make the most of their resources and to prepare for recurrent shocks and chronic stresses. The SMART curriculum is skills-based and organizes these topics under five key skills: (Group management/organization, Natural Resource Management, Finance, Marketing, Innovation).\r\nCommunities promote gender inclusion in governance activities:Â  CRS will seek greater female participation across SO1 activities by including the training of â€œGender Championsâ€ to act as community-level advocates for increased awareness of issues relating to gender equality. The 198 Gender Champions - a man and woman nominated by each of the 99 target villagesâ€™ CAC in consultation with the village chief - will participate in a three-day training in Mbuji Mayi on topics including SGBV prevention, the importance of joint decision making among couples, changing norms around child and forced marriage, among other topics identified during the gender analysis included in the baseline assessement.",

The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of NRCâ€™s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC's principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.\r\n\r\nNRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC's programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.\r\n\r\nNRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. \r\n\r\nThe interventionâ€™s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sidaâ€™s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach â€“ PBA).\r\n\r\nHumanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus\r\nNRC's catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC's advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC's analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC's portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden's development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid. \r\n\r\n1.2 MSEK is granted in June 2021 for supporting the IASC's review of the implementation of the IASC protection policy, through a 10 month consultancy hosted by NRC.\r\n\r\n40 MSEK are granted to NRC in Colombia and Venezuela regions (5+5 MSEK), Mali (5 MSEK), Mozambique (7.5 MSEK), Niger (7.5 MSEK) and Syria (10 MSEK) in June 2021 as reserve allocations to escalating and/or under-funding crises.

            "Description": "Vision, Humanitarian Policy and Humanitarian Plan\r\nThe overall objective of the intervention is to contribute to the promotion of three Breakthroughs in the way children are treated in the world:Â Survive, LearnÂ andÂ Be Protected.Â TheseÂ are part of the Save the Children movement's Vision for 2030 and are defined as remarkable and sustainable shifts from current trends that Save the Children aspires to work to achieve for children. Their respective objective is the following:\r\nSurvive: No child dies of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.Â \r\nLearn: All children learn from quality basic education.\r\nBe Protected: Violence against children is no longer tolerated.Â \r\nFor the upcoming agreement period 2021-2025, SCS has identified several aims under each breakthrough that it seeks to promote with Sida's humanitarian funding.\r\nAll Country Offices within Save the Children are to be held accountable for their contribution to the Breakthroughs through a combination of programming, promotion, advocacy, funding and public mobilization. This is assessed to require integrated expertise in health, nutrition, education, child protection, child poverty and child rights governance. The work will be undertaken by SCS as part of both its development and humanitarian programming.Â \r\nThe humanitarian sphere of work related to the Breakthroughs is anchored in the Save the Children movement's Humanitarian Policy - Our Approach to Humanitarian Action,Â adopted in 2019. It stipulates that Save the Children aims to deliver humanitarian assistance that is timely, appropriate, effective and accountable to the most vulnerable children, their families and communities. Furthermore, during 2021, the work is guided in particular by its Humanitarian Plan 2021 - Children Cannot Wait. The plan is structured around four pillars, of which the first three align with the three strategic Breakthroughs: Child Survival, Access to Education, andÂ Child Protection.Â The fourth pillar isÂ Avoid Negative Coping Mechanisms,Â which sets out the aim for Save the Children to promote increased income opportunities, CVA for basic needs, in-kind food when CVA is not appropriate, as well as government social protection schemes.Â The overarching ambition of the Plan is for Save the Children to respond to the humanitarian needs of 15.7 million people, including 9.4 million children, in 2021.\r\nFinally, to achieve the Breakthroughs, Save the Children emphasizes the importance of standards in its programming. For this reason, its Humanitarian Policy commits the organization to ensure that its programming consistently aligns with and integrates the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS), the Sphere standards, the Inter- Agency Network for Education In Emergencies (INEE) minimum standards, and the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS).Â \r\nCentrality of ProtectionÂ \r\nIn 2019, aÂ Centrality of ProtectionÂ policy and strategy was endorsed in line with the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Principles Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action (2013). Through the statement, protection became recognized as the purpose and intended outcome of humanitarian action. For Save the Children, the commitment to Centrality of Protection is built around six policy statements:Â \r\n1.Â Ensure capacity of humanitarian staff to understand, recognise and respond to violations of International Humanitarian Law/International Human Rights Law/International Refugee Law/International Criminal Law and uphold humanitarian principles in humanitarian crises.\r\n2.Â Adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to the centrality of protection.\r\n3.Â Systematize the approach to child protection analysis and integration in humanitarian crises.\r\n4.Â Commit to the identification, response, monitoring and reporting of grave and other serious child rights violations.\r\n5.Â Define the organizational position and develop an appropriate response when identifying the erosion of the international legal framework for upholding child rights in humanitarian contexts.\r\n6.Â Strengthen interagency collaboration, including as a Cluster Lead agency, and use that to promote child rights within the humanitarian protection architecture.\r\nFor SCS's Sida-funded Humanitarian Program 2021-2025, Centrality of Protection has been proposed as the thematic frame, making theÂ Be ProtectedÂ breakthrough particularly central for its interventions. It would entail a broader conceptualization of protection than during the agreement period 2017-2020, which had the thematic frameÂ Children and Armed Conflict,Â with a specific focus onÂ Protecting Children in Conflict.Â The key difference would be moving beyond preventing protection risks faced by children through child protection-focused interventions, towards integrating the mitigation of protection risks into all SCS's sectors of work whenever relevant. The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high. In 2020, more than 4.1 million people were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, and it is estimated that over 2.3. million individuals will be in need of protection services in 2021. Moreover, 1.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced, many of whom facing additional vulnerabilities as a result of the Government of Iraq's announcement in October 2020 that all camps and informal locations for Internally Displaced People (IDP) are to be closed.Â Â \r\nSave the Children has significant experience of addressing humanitarian needs in Iraq. In their activities, they include capacity strengthening for the Department of Labour and Social Affairs and other local actors working with child protection-related issues. Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

            "Description": "Vision, Humanitarian Policy and Humanitarian Plan\r\nThe overall objective of the intervention is to contribute to the promotion of three Breakthroughs in the way children are treated in the world:Â Survive, LearnÂ andÂ Be Protected.Â TheseÂ are part of the Save the Children movement's Vision for 2030 and are defined as remarkable and sustainable shifts from current trends that Save the Children aspires to work to achieve for children. Their respective objective is the following:\r\nSurvive: No child dies of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.Â \r\nLearn: All children learn from quality basic education.\r\nBe Protected: Violence against children is no longer tolerated.Â \r\nFor the upcoming agreement period 2021-2025, SCS has identified several aims under each breakthrough that it seeks to promote with Sida's humanitarian funding.\r\nAll Country Offices within Save the Children are to be held accountable for their contribution to the Breakthroughs through a combination of programming, promotion, advocacy, funding and public mobilization. This is assessed to require integrated expertise in health, nutrition, education, child protection, child poverty and child rights governance. The work will be undertaken by SCS as part of both its development and humanitarian programming.Â \r\nThe humanitarian sphere of work related to the Breakthroughs is anchored in the Save the Children movement's Humanitarian Policy - Our Approach to Humanitarian Action,Â adopted in 2019. It stipulates that Save the Children aims to deliver humanitarian assistance that is timely, appropriate, effective and accountable to the most vulnerable children, their families and communities. Furthermore, during 2021, the work is guided in particular by its Humanitarian Plan 2021 - Children Cannot Wait. The plan is structured around four pillars, of which the first three align with the three strategic Breakthroughs: Child Survival, Access to Education, andÂ Child Protection.Â The fourth pillar isÂ Avoid Negative Coping Mechanisms,Â which sets out the aim for Save the Children to promote increased income opportunities, CVA for basic needs, in-kind food when CVA is not appropriate, as well as government social protection schemes.Â The overarching ambition of the Plan is for Save the Children to respond to the humanitarian needs of 15.7 million people, including 9.4 million children, in 2021.\r\nFinally, to achieve the Breakthroughs, Save the Children emphasizes the importance of standards in its programming. For this reason, its Humanitarian Policy commits the organization to ensure that its programming consistently aligns with and integrates the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS), the Sphere standards, the Inter- Agency Network for Education In Emergencies (INEE) minimum standards, and the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS).Â \r\nCentrality of ProtectionÂ \r\nIn 2019, aÂ Centrality of ProtectionÂ policy and strategy was endorsed in line with the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Principles Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action (2013). Through the statement, protection became recognized as the purpose and intended outcome of humanitarian action. For Save the Children, the commitment to Centrality of Protection is built around six policy statements:Â \r\n1.Â Ensure capacity of humanitarian staff to understand, recognise and respond to violations of International Humanitarian Law/International Human Rights Law/International Refugee Law/International Criminal Law and uphold humanitarian principles in humanitarian crises.\r\n2.Â Adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to the centrality of protection.\r\n3.Â Systematize the approach to child protection analysis and integration in humanitarian crises.\r\n4.Â Commit to the identification, response, monitoring and reporting of grave and other serious child rights violations.\r\n5.Â Define the organizational position and develop an appropriate response when identifying the erosion of the international legal framework for upholding child rights in humanitarian contexts.\r\n6.Â Strengthen interagency collaboration, including as a Cluster Lead agency, and use that to promote child rights within the humanitarian protection architecture.\r\nFor SCS's Sida-funded Humanitarian Program 2021-2025, Centrality of Protection has been proposed as the thematic frame, making theÂ Be ProtectedÂ breakthrough particularly central for its interventions. It would entail a broader conceptualization of protection than during the agreement period 2017-2020, which had the thematic frameÂ Children and Armed Conflict,Â with a specific focus onÂ Protecting Children in Conflict.Â The key difference would be moving beyond preventing protection risks faced by children through child protection-focused interventions, towards integrating the mitigation of protection risks into all SCS's sectors of work whenever relevant. The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high. In 2020, more than 4.1 million people were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, and it is estimated that over 2.3. million individuals will be in need of protection services in 2021. Moreover, 1.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced, many of whom facing additional vulnerabilities as a result of the Government of Iraq's announcement in October 2020 that all camps and informal locations for Internally Displaced People (IDP) are to be closed.Â Â \r\nSave the Children has significant experience of addressing humanitarian needs in Iraq. In their activities, they include capacity strengthening for the Department of Labour and Social Affairs and other local actors working with child protection-related issues. Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high. In 2020, more than 4.1 million people were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, and it is estimated that over 2.3. million individuals will be in need of protection services in 2021. Moreover, 1.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced, many of whom facing additional vulnerabilities as a result of the Government of Iraq's announcement in October 2020 that all camps and informal locations for Internally Displaced People (IDP) are to be closed.Â Â \r\nSave the Children has significant experience of addressing humanitarian needs in Iraq. In their activities, they include capacity strengthening for the Department of Labour and Social Affairs and other local actors working with child protection-related issues. Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

            "Description": "Vision, Humanitarian Policy and Humanitarian Plan\r\nThe overall objective of the intervention is to contribute to the promotion of three Breakthroughs in the way children are treated in the world:Â Survive, LearnÂ andÂ Be Protected.Â TheseÂ are part of the Save the Children movement's Vision for 2030 and are defined as remarkable and sustainable shifts from current trends that Save the Children aspires to work to achieve for children. Their respective objective is the following:\r\nSurvive: No child dies of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.Â \r\nLearn: All children learn from quality basic education.\r\nBe Protected: Violence against children is no longer tolerated.Â \r\nFor the upcoming agreement period 2021-2025, SCS has identified several aims under each breakthrough that it seeks to promote with Sida's humanitarian funding.\r\nAll Country Offices within Save the Children are to be held accountable for their contribution to the Breakthroughs through a combination of programming, promotion, advocacy, funding and public mobilization. This is assessed to require integrated expertise in health, nutrition, education, child protection, child poverty and child rights governance. The work will be undertaken by SCS as part of both its development and humanitarian programming.Â \r\nThe humanitarian sphere of work related to the Breakthroughs is anchored in the Save the Children movement's Humanitarian Policy - Our Approach to Humanitarian Action,Â adopted in 2019. It stipulates that Save the Children aims to deliver humanitarian assistance that is timely, appropriate, effective and accountable to the most vulnerable children, their families and communities. Furthermore, during 2021, the work is guided in particular by its Humanitarian Plan 2021 - Children Cannot Wait. The plan is structured around four pillars, of which the first three align with the three strategic Breakthroughs: Child Survival, Access to Education, andÂ Child Protection.Â The fourth pillar isÂ Avoid Negative Coping Mechanisms,Â which sets out the aim for Save the Children to promote increased income opportunities, CVA for basic needs, in-kind food when CVA is not appropriate, as well as government social protection schemes.Â The overarching ambition of the Plan is for Save the Children to respond to the humanitarian needs of 15.7 million people, including 9.4 million children, in 2021.\r\nFinally, to achieve the Breakthroughs, Save the Children emphasizes the importance of standards in its programming. For this reason, its Humanitarian Policy commits the organization to ensure that its programming consistently aligns with and integrates the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS), the Sphere standards, the Inter- Agency Network for Education In Emergencies (INEE) minimum standards, and the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS).Â \r\nCentrality of ProtectionÂ \r\nIn 2019, aÂ Centrality of ProtectionÂ policy and strategy was endorsed in line with the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Principles Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action (2013). Through the statement, protection became recognized as the purpose and intended outcome of humanitarian action. For Save the Children, the commitment to Centrality of Protection is built around six policy statements:Â \r\n1.Â Ensure capacity of humanitarian staff to understand, recognise and respond to violations of International Humanitarian Law/International Human Rights Law/International Refugee Law/International Criminal Law and uphold humanitarian principles in humanitarian crises.\r\n2.Â Adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to the centrality of protection.\r\n3.Â Systematize the approach to child protection analysis and integration in humanitarian crises.\r\n4.Â Commit to the identification, response, monitoring and reporting of grave and other serious child rights violations.\r\n5.Â Define the organizational position and develop an appropriate response when identifying the erosion of the international legal framework for upholding child rights in humanitarian contexts.\r\n6.Â Strengthen interagency collaboration, including as a Cluster Lead agency, and use that to promote child rights within the humanitarian protection architecture.\r\nFor SCS's Sida-funded Humanitarian Program 2021-2025, Centrality of Protection has been proposed as the thematic frame, making theÂ Be ProtectedÂ breakthrough particularly central for its interventions. It would entail a broader conceptualization of protection than during the agreement period 2017-2020, which had the thematic frameÂ Children and Armed Conflict,Â with a specific focus onÂ Protecting Children in Conflict.Â The key difference would be moving beyond preventing protection risks faced by children through child protection-focused interventions, towards integrating the mitigation of protection risks into all SCS's sectors of work whenever relevant. The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high.

The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

            "Description": "Vision, Humanitarian Policy and Humanitarian Plan\r\nThe overall objective of the intervention is to contribute to the promotion of three Breakthroughs in the way children are treated in the world:Â Survive, LearnÂ andÂ Be Protected.Â TheseÂ are part of the Save the Children movement's Vision for 2030 and are defined as remarkable and sustainable shifts from current trends that Save the Children aspires to work to achieve for children. Their respective objective is the following:\r\nSurvive: No child dies of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.Â \r\nLearn: All children learn from quality basic education.\r\nBe Protected: Violence against children is no longer tolerated.Â \r\nFor the upcoming agreement period 2021-2025, SCS has identified several aims under each breakthrough that it seeks to promote with Sida's humanitarian funding.\r\nAll Country Offices within Save the Children are to be held accountable for their contribution to the Breakthroughs through a combination of programming, promotion, advocacy, funding and public mobilization. This is assessed to require integrated expertise in health, nutrition, education, child protection, child poverty and child rights governance. The work will be undertaken by SCS as part of both its development and humanitarian programming.Â \r\nThe humanitarian sphere of work related to the Breakthroughs is anchored in the Save the Children movement's Humanitarian Policy - Our Approach to Humanitarian Action,Â adopted in 2019. It stipulates that Save the Children aims to deliver humanitarian assistance that is timely, appropriate, effective and accountable to the most vulnerable children, their families and communities. Furthermore, during 2021, the work is guided in particular by its Humanitarian Plan 2021 - Children Cannot Wait. The plan is structured around four pillars, of which the first three align with the three strategic Breakthroughs: Child Survival, Access to Education, andÂ Child Protection.Â The fourth pillar isÂ Avoid Negative Coping Mechanisms,Â which sets out the aim for Save the Children to promote increased income opportunities, CVA for basic needs, in-kind food when CVA is not appropriate, as well as government social protection schemes.Â The overarching ambition of the Plan is for Save the Children to respond to the humanitarian needs of 15.7 million people, including 9.4 million children, in 2021.\r\nFinally, to achieve the Breakthroughs, Save the Children emphasizes the importance of standards in its programming. For this reason, its Humanitarian Policy commits the organization to ensure that its programming consistently aligns with and integrates the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS), the Sphere standards, the Inter- Agency Network for Education In Emergencies (INEE) minimum standards, and the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS).Â \r\nCentrality of ProtectionÂ \r\nIn 2019, aÂ Centrality of ProtectionÂ policy and strategy was endorsed in line with the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Principles Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action (2013). Through the statement, protection became recognized as the purpose and intended outcome of humanitarian action. For Save the Children, the commitment to Centrality of Protection is built around six policy statements:Â \r\n1.Â Ensure capacity of humanitarian staff to understand, recognise and respond to violations of International Humanitarian Law/International Human Rights Law/International Refugee Law/International Criminal Law and uphold humanitarian principles in humanitarian crises.\r\n2.Â Adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to the centrality of protection.\r\n3.Â Systematize the approach to child protection analysis and integration in humanitarian crises.\r\n4.Â Commit to the identification, response, monitoring and reporting of grave and other serious child rights violations.\r\n5.Â Define the organizational position and develop an appropriate response when identifying the erosion of the international legal framework for upholding child rights in humanitarian contexts.\r\n6.Â Strengthen interagency collaboration, including as a Cluster Lead agency, and use that to promote child rights within the humanitarian protection architecture.\r\nFor SCS's Sida-funded Humanitarian Program 2021-2025, Centrality of Protection has been proposed as the thematic frame, making theÂ Be ProtectedÂ breakthrough particularly central for its interventions. It would entail a broader conceptualization of protection than during the agreement period 2017-2020, which had the thematic frameÂ Children and Armed Conflict,Â with a specific focus onÂ Protecting Children in Conflict.Â The key difference would be moving beyond preventing protection risks faced by children through child protection-focused interventions, towards integrating the mitigation of protection risks into all SCS's sectors of work whenever relevant. The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high. In 2020, more than 4.1 million people were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, and it is estimated that over 2.3. million individuals will be in need of protection services in 2021. Moreover, 1.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced, many of whom facing additional vulnerabilities as a result of the Government of Iraq's announcement in October 2020 that all camps and informal locations for Internally Displaced People (IDP) are to be closed.Â Â \r\nSave the Children has significant experience of addressing humanitarian needs in Iraq. In their activities, they include capacity strengthening for the Department of Labour and Social Affairs and other local actors working with child protection-related issues. Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks.

Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

            "Description": "Vision, Humanitarian Policy and Humanitarian Plan\r\nThe overall objective of the intervention is to contribute to the promotion of three Breakthroughs in the way children are treated in the world:Â Survive, LearnÂ andÂ Be Protected.Â TheseÂ are part of the Save the Children movement's Vision for 2030 and are defined as remarkable and sustainable shifts from current trends that Save the Children aspires to work to achieve for children. Their respective objective is the following:\r\nSurvive: No child dies of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.Â \r\nLearn: All children learn from quality basic education.\r\nBe Protected: Violence against children is no longer tolerated.Â \r\nFor the upcoming agreement period 2021-2025, SCS has identified several aims under each breakthrough that it seeks to promote with Sida's humanitarian funding.\r\nAll Country Offices within Save the Children are to be held accountable for their contribution to the Breakthroughs through a combination of programming, promotion, advocacy, funding and public mobilization. This is assessed to require integrated expertise in health, nutrition, education, child protection, child poverty and child rights governance. The work will be undertaken by SCS as part of both its development and humanitarian programming.Â \r\nThe humanitarian sphere of work related to the Breakthroughs is anchored in the Save the Children movement's Humanitarian Policy - Our Approach to Humanitarian Action,Â adopted in 2019. It stipulates that Save the Children aims to deliver humanitarian assistance that is timely, appropriate, effective and accountable to the most vulnerable children, their families and communities. Furthermore, during 2021, the work is guided in particular by its Humanitarian Plan 2021 - Children Cannot Wait. The plan is structured around four pillars, of which the first three align with the three strategic Breakthroughs: Child Survival, Access to Education, andÂ Child Protection.Â The fourth pillar isÂ Avoid Negative Coping Mechanisms,Â which sets out the aim for Save the Children to promote increased income opportunities, CVA for basic needs, in-kind food when CVA is not appropriate, as well as government social protection schemes.Â The overarching ambition of the Plan is for Save the Children to respond to the humanitarian needs of 15.7 million people, including 9.4 million children, in 2021.\r\nFinally, to achieve the Breakthroughs, Save the Children emphasizes the importance of standards in its programming. For this reason, its Humanitarian Policy commits the organization to ensure that its programming consistently aligns with and integrates the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS), the Sphere standards, the Inter- Agency Network for Education In Emergencies (INEE) minimum standards, and the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS).Â \r\nCentrality of ProtectionÂ \r\nIn 2019, aÂ Centrality of ProtectionÂ policy and strategy was endorsed in line with the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Principles Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action (2013). Through the statement, protection became recognized as the purpose and intended outcome of humanitarian action. For Save the Children, the commitment to Centrality of Protection is built around six policy statements:Â \r\n1.Â Ensure capacity of humanitarian staff to understand, recognise and respond to violations of International Humanitarian Law/International Human Rights Law/International Refugee Law/International Criminal Law and uphold humanitarian principles in humanitarian crises.\r\n2.Â Adopt a conflict-sensitive approach to the centrality of protection.\r\n3.Â Systematize the approach to child protection analysis and integration in humanitarian crises.\r\n4.Â Commit to the identification, response, monitoring and reporting of grave and other serious child rights violations.\r\n5.Â Define the organizational position and develop an appropriate response when identifying the erosion of the international legal framework for upholding child rights in humanitarian contexts.\r\n6.Â Strengthen interagency collaboration, including as a Cluster Lead agency, and use that to promote child rights within the humanitarian protection architecture.\r\nFor SCS's Sida-funded Humanitarian Program 2021-2025, Centrality of Protection has been proposed as the thematic frame, making theÂ Be ProtectedÂ breakthrough particularly central for its interventions. It would entail a broader conceptualization of protection than during the agreement period 2017-2020, which had the thematic frameÂ Children and Armed Conflict,Â with a specific focus onÂ Protecting Children in Conflict.Â The key difference would be moving beyond preventing protection risks faced by children through child protection-focused interventions, towards integrating the mitigation of protection risks into all SCS's sectors of work whenever relevant. The ambition is to promote a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing child protection concerns in contrast to doing so in isolation.\r\nInitial Allocation 2021\r\nIn alignment with Save the Children's ambitions related to its Vision for 2030 and the three strategic Breakthroughs, its Humanitarian Policy, its Humanitarian Plan, as well as Sida's HumanitarianÂ Strategy, SCS has submitted a Full Project Proposal to Sida for 2021.Â Sida has reviewed these proposals and drawn the conclusion that they align well with the abovementioned priorities as well as the proposed Centrality of Protection thematic frame. Below, aÂ short description is provided for the proposed projects to be supported by Sida as part of the initial allocation 2021. The activity period for each project is 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, which corresponds to the 2021 work year.Â \r\nI. Annual ProjectsÂ (in line with the most recent Humanitarian Response Plans)\r\nIraq - SEK 15,000,000\r\nThree years after the end of Iraqâ€™s conflict against ISIS, the impacts of fighting remain high. In 2020, more than 4.1 million people were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, and it is estimated that over 2.3. million individuals will be in need of protection services in 2021. Moreover, 1.3 million people are estimated to be internally displaced, many of whom facing additional vulnerabilities as a result of the Government of Iraq's announcement in October 2020 that all camps and informal locations for Internally Displaced People (IDP) are to be closed.Â Â \r\nSave the Children has significant experience of addressing humanitarian needs in Iraq. In their activities, they include capacity strengthening for the Department of Labour and Social Affairs and other local actors working with child protection-related issues. Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

Furthermore, Save the Children has a strong localization focus, with 40 % of the funds designated for the proposed intervention planned for to be forwarded to the three local implementing partners: Harikar; Al Sorouh for Sustainable Development Foundation; and Sahara Economic Development Organization.Â \r\nSave the Children has previously reported good results from their interventions in Iraq and has contributed to the reduction of protection risks that vulnerable girls and boys and their caregivers face. Moreover, Save the Children is co-lead in the Child Protection sub-cluster and has a role to play in the future transition to development interventions in this area of work.\r\nThe project would be implemented in Ninewa (Mosul), Diyala (Mugidadia) and Dohuk (Sakho) with IDPs, recent returnees and vulnerable host communities as the targeted groups. The overall objective is to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected and displaced to survive and be protected through integrated protection, mental health and psychosocial support services, livelihoods and health actions. In alignment with the three Strategic Objectives of the draft HRP for 2021, this would be done by, inter alia, providing case management and positive parenting support services (benefitting 3,420 children and youth), multipurpose cash grants (1,320 children and 660 adults), life skills trainings (300 youth), promoting health awareness (3,000 children and 10,000 community members) and capacitating local actors to lead protection-oriented responses (520 persons).Â \r\nMali - SEK 7,000,000\r\nOf the estimated 13.5 million crisis-affected Malians, around 7.1 million are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021 - an increase of 39 percent compared to 2020. Of these people, 3.5 million are estimated to be children. The worst affected region is Mopti, where approximately 42 % of the country's 311,193 IDPs reside (55 % of whom are women), food insecurity is pervasive and severe protection risks exist. The dire situation is mainly a result of different types of ongoing armed violence, but isÂ compounded by poverty, weak state presence and climate change.\r\nIn alignment with the first three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 HRP, the proposed intervention targets 8,940 people living in Koro and Bankass circles in Mopti region (4,700 children and 3,790 adults). It is an integrated protection intervention with a strong focus on promoting sustained outcomes. The objective is to restore the psychosocial well-being and addressing the basic needs of populations affected by the armed violence as well as to strengthen the protective environment in the region. This would be done through the provision of protection and education services, cash assistance during the lean season, and the implementation of the protection cluster's Centrality of Protection action plan.\r\nOf the budget, 60 % is designated for direct implementation by Save the Children, and the remainder for a planned partnership with a local organization. The partner organization is yet to be identified, and Sida is currently in dialogue with SCS related to this risk and potential contingency planning.\r\nCapacity building and material support is also planned for to local state actors and community groups for them to sustain the protection support structure in Mopti following the finalization of the project. This includes developing an exit plan to be implemented during the last three months of the project (January to March 2022).Â \r\nMozambique - SEK 6,000,000\r\nEver since cyclone Kenneth struck the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique in April 2019 causing widespread destruction, humanitarian needs have continued to increase. The main reason for this has been the parallel escalation of an armed conflict in the province that dawned in 2017. Between March and November 2020 alone, the number of IDPs quadrupled from around 110,400 to nearly 530,000. In total,Â over 1.3 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian support in the province during 2021.\r\nSida has provided support to Save the Children for responding to humanitarian needs in Cabo Delgado since cyclone Kenneth in 2019 and is diversifying its partner portfolio from 2021. The proposed support for Save the Children aligns specifically with the third strategic objective of the 2021 HRP - addressing protection risks and needs of crisis-affected people. As such, it is foremostly a focused rather than an integrated intervention, and targets 33,346 people (13,338 children) in the districts of Chuire, Metuge, Montepuez and Pemba.Â \r\nThe intervention is planned for to be implemented in partnership with CARE International throught he COSACA consortium, which has been operating in Mozambique since 2007. It is focused around two Outcomes: child protection (led by Save the Children) and gender-based violence (led by CARE International. The overarching aim is to ensure crisis-affected people are protected and better able to withstand protection risks of current and future crises. Activities include case management support for unaccompanied and separated children as well as children exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and the provision of Psychosocial Support Services at Child Friendly Spaces.Â \r\nSouth Sudan - SEK 10,000,000\r\nIn South Sudan, approximately 80 % of the population of 11.8 million live on less than USD 1 per day, with an estimated 8.3 million to be in need of humanitarian assistance and 7.7 million to experience food insecurity (IPC 3 or worse). One of the worst affected states is Jonglei where the armed conflict intensified in 2020, and where needs were compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as floods. The latter in particular, and volatile weather and climate change in general, pose significant threats to many South Sudanese as the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming.Â \r\nThe objective of the proposed intervention is to improve food and income security of crisis affected people - including IDPs - in Bor South and Nyirol Counties of Jonglei State. The total number of people targeted is 52,183. The intervention would be integrated with an ongoing education project with the aim of building a safe and protective environment for children, which is currently receiving development support from Sida. This would foremostly be done by preventing dropout rates through cash assistance and livelihoods trainings, and by meeting nutritional needs of children under the age of five in order to prevent them from suffering physical or cognitive damages ahead of enrolling in school. The humanitarian project would be multisectoral - food security and livelihood, nutrition, child protection, mental health and psychosocial support, and with indirect links to education.Â \r\nThe project would contribute to the three Strategic Objectives of the 2020 South Sudan HRP:Â reducing morbidity and mortality; facilitating safe, equitable and dignified access to basic services; and enabling vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement and build resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. Save the Children would partner with the local organization Christian Recovery and Development Agency (CRADA) in Nyirol for part of the food security and livelihood component, and cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, County Health Department, and Ministry of Gender.\r\nSyria - SEK 10,000,000\r\nAbout to enter its tenth year, the war in Syria has devastated the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live in overcrowded camps with insufficient services and imminent protection risks. In two of these camps located in northeast Syria - Al Hol and Roj - over 64,400 people live. In Al Hol, 94 % of the residents are women and children, and 53 % are below the age of 12. Around 60 % of children are not receiving education, with Covid-19 having further exacerbated this situation. In Roj, 64 % of the residents are below 18 years old, many similarly missing out on education opportunities.Â \r\nA barrier analysis conducted by Save the Children in mid-2020 indicated lacking access to services as a major concern, in particular for vulnerable groups such as girls and children with disabilities. The proposed intervention would address this issue through the provision of integrated protection, mental health, psychosocial, and education support reaching a targeted 1,700 children, 140 caregivers and 22 education facilitators. Activities include providing case management and psychosocial support services, making referrals, supporting child protection committees and promoting protective education opportunities.Â \r\nThe intervention would contribute specifically to Strategic Objective 2 -Â enhance protection and Strategic Objective 3 -Â increase resilience and access to services,Â of the 2020 HRP for Syria, published in late 2020. Being one of few NGOs with access to operate in the camps, Save the Children would be conducting all implementation, while seeking to advocate with camp authorities on child-related issues and strengthen community structures such as child protection committees and parent teachers associations to promote resilience.Â \r\nYemen - SEK 15,000,000\r\nOCHA estimates that 24.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance (as of December 2020), which corresponds to around 80 % of the entire population. One of the governorates most severely affected by the war is Hajjah, with frontlines in Abs, Mustaba and Aslem where people suffer from severe deprivations and increased protection risks. In February 2019, for example, 62 % of cases of recruitment and use of children and 37 % of child casualties verified across the country were from Hajjah. In addition to the hostilities, displacement and lack of access are the main drivers of humanitarian needs, in particular food insecurity. Moreover, 5.5 million children were estimated to be in need of education assistance in 2020, with 161 schools in Hajjah unfit for use and girls being two times more likely th be withdrawn from school than boys.Â \r\nThe proposed support is for an integrated food security and livelihoods, child protection and education intervention to 7,800 people (no double counting) in Abs district and Hajjah city. This will be done by, inter alia, providing multipurpose cash grants to adolescents and caregivers to cover basic needs, most of whom would also receive complementary vocational training with the aim to improve their livelihoods resilience. With regards to child protection, moreover, support services would complement education efforts by targeting children attending temporary learning spaces with psychosocial support and case management when needed.Â \r\nSave the Children's operations have previously suffered severely from restricted access - in 2019, merely 13 % of targeted beneficiaries for a Sida-funded project were reached in four northern provinces (including Hajjah), prompting Save the Children to shift its operations to southern Yemen in 2020. The outlook is currently that Save the Children would be able to conduct the intervention as planned for 2021, but Sida will need to engage in close dialogue with SCS during the year to ensure operations are running smoothly and that Sida is promptly informed otherwise.Â \r\nFinally, Ansar Allah, largely in control of north Yemen, has been subjected to a terrorist designation by the US as of 19 January 2021. Sida, Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is therefore in close contact with its partners on the potential impact of the designation on the humanitarian situation in the country, as well as the SCSâ€™s specific activities and presence. Moreover, a risk analysis is being developed by each partner to identify challenges and mitigation measures.\r\nII. Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) - SEK 25,000,000\r\nPart of the annual humanitarian budget is set aside for sudden onsets of humanitarian crises and as well as deteriorations of major ongoing ones. For these situations, Sida has a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) that makes it possible to allow for the release of disbursed (but unallocated) funds for SPOs within 24 hours in order for them to swiftly respond whenÂ humanitarian needs suddenly emerge or severely deteriorate.\r\nSCS has been assessed by SidaÂ to have a strong capacity to respond to sudden onset crises in complex humanitarian contexts. For this reason, it is proposed that SCS receives SEK 25 million in RRM support for 2021.Â \r\nÂ \r\nÂ \r\nIII. Capacity Building and Method Development Support\r\nStrengthening Humanitarian Access - SEK 3,409,000\r\nAs raised above, the latest Annual Report of the UN Secretary General on Children and Armed Conflict outlined an increase of 453 percent in incidents of denial of humanitarian access in 2019, representing a total of more than 4,400 incidents. In recent years, the respect for norms governing armed conflict and humanitarian action has eroded, which undermines the ability of humanitarian organizations to reach people in need of assistance and places the onus on communities themselves to ensure access to assistance and services. Moreover, access restrictions are sometimes further compounded by counterterrorism and sanction measures preventing engagement with actors that might be in partial or direct control over areas where humanitarian needs exist.Â \r\nThe objective of this intervention is to address these issues by strengthening access for humanitarians and communities in hard-to-reach areas. It is divided along three objectives:Â \r\n1. Promote systematization of how Save the Children staff and partners engage in dialogue with armed actors. This includes providing, inter alia, capacity-building support for field workers and frontline teams in structuring their humanitarian negotiations.Â \r\n2. Facilitate communities to access services. 2021 would be the first year of a two-year effort to assemble knowledge and understanding and develop guidance to promote community-led child protection. The ambition is for this to then be piloted in selected constituencies during 2022 (no such funding for year two proposed for in this Appraisal Memo).Â \r\n3. Measuring the impact of denial of humanitarian access to children, including the effects of counterterrorism legislation. This would be done as a research project in partnership with Watchlist and the Fordham University's Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and be used for advocacy purposes.\r\nThis proposed project aligns with several objectives of Sida's Humanitarian Strategy's, in particular \"Humanitarian assistance and protection activities reach people in hard-to-reach areas\" and \"Humanitarian actors have safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access to reach crisis-affected people\".Â \r\nInteragency Child Protection Programming - SEK 2,184,000\r\nIn a constantly evolving humanitarian landscape there is aÂ need to ensure humanitarian actors respond to crises with quality and reach. To this effect, humanitarian standards are central instruments. Departing from this notion, the project aims to strengthen quality, accountability and efficiency in interagency child protection programming. It is based on two components: the Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS) and Cash and Voucher (CVA) assistance.Â \r\nFirst, together with the Sphere Protection Principles, the CPMS provide for a foundation of advancing Centrality of Protection in humanitarian programming, which was incorporated in the CPMS during 2019. However, funding for child protection is limited and prioritization of Centrality of Protection across sectors is oftentimes lacking. The proposed project seeks to address this by supporting innovation and local leadership through the CPMS Innovation Fund - granting financial support to national and local actors to lead implementation of the CPMS. Moreover, advocacy is planned for at the global level on how multi-sectoral actors' commitment to the Centrality of Protection can be realized and trickle down to programming at the country level.Â \r\nThe second component seeks to strengthen the use and evidence base for CVA in interagency child protection programming, which in part is a continuation of activities funded by Sida in 2020. It includes (i) the finalization and dissemination of an integrated CVA and Child Protection Monitoring, Evaluation, Assessment and Learning (MEAL) toolkit, (ii) undertaking a desk review on CVA for child-headed households and unaccompanied children, and (iii) finalizing guidance on conditions and capacities required to work with child protection using CVA.Â \r\nThis proposed project also aligns with several objectives of Sida's humanitarian Strategy's, including \"Reduced risk of violence, threats and abuse for crisis-affected people\", and \"Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the humanitarian system in line with Grand Bargain commitments\".Â \r\nIV. Global Surge Deployments - SEK 800,000\r\nIn 2017, a review was undertaken of the surge structure across the Save the Children movement, which resulted in a decision to transition it from a decentralized model where surge teams were hosted by different Members, to a centralized model hosted by SCI under what is called a Global Humanitarian Surge Platform (GHSP). The purpose was to increase the quality, speed and effectiveness of the global surge capacity, reducing the complexity of deployment procedures and increasing the visibility of supply and demand of staff. The GHSP was formally established in 2019, and managed 342 deployments in 2020.Â \r\nThe objective of Sida's proposed support to the GHSP is to ensure that Save the Children's humanitarian responses have access to rapidly deployable skilled and experienced staff needed to deliver high quality and timely humanitarian responses. During 2021, an estimated ten deployments of four weeks respectively are expected to be funded through Sida's support.Â \r\nV. Operational and Technical Support - SEK 5 000 000\r\nThis support is provided to SCS's HQ in Stockholm in order to engender high-quality management of - and compliance with - the draft Agreement during 2021. The support is divided between \"Operational Support\", \"Thematic and Quality Support\", \"Grants Management & Monitoring\", and \"Financial Management and Donor Relations\".Â \r\nSida's assessment of this support is provided in more detail in section 5.1. below.",

            "Description": "The four IOs of the consortiumÂ will support scaling the adoption of new climate-adapted technologies and practices for sustainable diversification and intensification of cereal, legume and vegetable crop production. In doing so, the interventions aims to improve household nutrition through increased food availability and dietary diversity from diversified farming systems that can grow more demand-preferred crops and nutritious foods, which can then be sold to market or consumed by households. With this intervention, it is expected that 15,500 producers will be assisted in CSA, GAP and ISFM technologies universally recognized as environmentally friendly. In order to implement the intervention, theÂ IOs have complementary goals, operate at different levels in value chains, and maintain strong relationships with farmers and private sector actors, leading to the facilitation of synergies and increased impact in the field.\r\nTo ensure an impactful implementation of the programme the MO and the IOs intend to set up a team of Monitoring and Evaluation Officers (one from each organisation) to monitor and identify trends, successes, and bottlenecks in order to make course-corrections and share learnings between the IOs during the implementation of FAR II.The MO will measure progress in the following three result areas:\r\nÂ \r\nResults Area 1: Scaling Improved Smallholder Productivity \r\nTo improve access to and use of improved inputs, seeds, and fertilizers (such as high-yielding varieties and appropriate fertilizer blends), The programme will provide capacity building support to strengthen existing VLSAs and Farmers Organizations. This will facilitate access to capital for the purchase of agricultural inputs that can guarantee access to markets for demand-preferred crops and produce. This will be achieved through promoting climate-adapted crops/varieties and by facilitating the purchase and installation of renewable energy mini agro-processing equipment to create value-added and enable and local production/consumption.\r\nÂ \r\nResults Area 2: Scaling Agro-Dealer Networks for Input/Output Market Development\r\nÂ \r\nTo achieve the result targets of \"Result Area 1\", the program need to scale up agro-dealer distribution networks to enable the distribution and use of productivity-enhancing inputs and production technologies for farmers. To accomplish this, the programme will support village-based agents (VBAs) and rural based agro-dealer start-ups linked to agro-dealer networks.Â To capacitate actors that link farmers to market, FAR II intend to provide enterprise management capacity building on working capital, stock control, costing and pricing, financial literacy and record keeping, and ICT financial services for agribusiness.Â Scaling agro-dealers and agents through the â€œhubâ€ approach is expected to result in more efficient distribution networks that can reach smallholder farmers with more cost-efficient and cost-effective products and services. VBAs and agro-dealers will also receive training on output marketing and linked to traders.\r\nÂ \r\nResults Area 3: Scaling Proven Technologies\r\nIn order toÂ provide the technical support needed to scale CSA / GAP technologies for sustainable intensification of cereal, legume and vegetable production, the FAR II Consortium will utalize their partnerships scale dissemination of â€œtechnology packagesâ€ to farmer organizations or clusters through networked partnerships with public and private sector actors. This will be done through e.g. providingÂ technical support to farmers and agro-dealers on how to set up farm demonstrations and testing of improved inputs. The IOs will also promte the expanision of ICT technolgie, such as M-phone for mobile-base e-payments that to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and innovative and sustainable applications for ICT4Ag to benefit Mozambican farmers through better access to information (e.g. on prices).\r\nÂ \r\nKPIs for follow-up (subject to measurement of gender disaggregated results):\r\n1) Number of farmers who adopted CSA / GAP promoted by the program\r\n2) Average increase in crop yield in kilograms per hectare and annual season\r\n3) Number of agro-dealers and VBAs trained and established\r\n4) Volume of inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer, and agrochemical products, etc.) sold through agro-dealer networks\r\n5) Value of inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer, and agrochemical products, etc.) sold through agro-dealer networks\r\n6) Number of farmers accessing inputs and agronomic extension services through agro-dealer networks\r\n7) Volume of agricultural products (grains and pulses) sold through agro-dealer networks\r\n8) Value of agricultural products (grains and pulses) sold through agro-dealer networks\r\n9) Number of CSA technologies adopted by farmers\r\n10) Number agribusinesses, agro-dealers and entrepreneurs who improve operational capacities as a result of skills training\r\n11) Number agribusinesses, agro-dealers and entrepreneurs who improve operational capacities as a result of skills training",

            "Description": "The Great Conservation Landscape is an encompassing ecosystem with a high concentration of biodiversity. It comprises the Gran Chaco Americano ecoregion (the second forest biome in South America, which extends between Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil), El Pantanal (the largest aquifer in the world) and La Chiquitania (one of the biggest dry forest in the world).\r\n\r\nIn 2019 and 2020 Bolivia has been facing huge wildfires and droughts mainly in the lowlands. The forest fires that occurred from July to September 2019, caused the loss of 5.3 million hectares in Bolivia, most of them within the Great Conservation Landscape. Of the total burned area, 3.3 million hectares (62%) correspond to non-forested areas and 2 million hectares (38%) to forest areas; of which 1.4 million hectares correspond to the endemic Chiquitano forestâ€ (Villalobos, 2021). The fires also affected the protected areas of the Great Conservation Landscape, â€œa total of 1,549,924 ha. of protected natural areas have been burned.  It is also estimated that 1,961,649 hectares were burned within eight RAMSAR sites, which are wetlands of global importance for the conservation of migratory, seasonal and numerous birds \". (Guardiana, 2021).\r\n\r\nMost of the forest fires (a sixth generation wildfire characteristic) in the Great Landscape are generated by the expansion of the agricultural frontier, supported by agribusiness actors, colonization processes and, the existence of a black market for land, in connection with other processes such as the Bioceanic Corridor and its megaprojects, mining, iron and steel, road and river infrastructure.\r\n\r\nDue to the extension of the territory, no control can be exercised to prevent fires before they occur, because they are carried out stealthily (in a sixth-generation wildfire the fire can exceed a speed of 4,000 hectares per hour). Therefore, a comprehensive action must be promoted to work on the causes to stop this practice, meanwhile it is of extreme urgency to strengthen the capacities to control the fires caused.\r\n\r\nBased on this, the Embassy wants to support a Bolivian local non-governmental organization called NATIVA through a simplified contribution of around SEK 4,000,000 on reducing the risk of large forest fires, as well as their consequences on biodiversity and indigenous settlement.\r\n\r\nThe main objective is to support four local municipal governments (municipalities of San JosÃ© de Chiquitos, Robore, Puerto Suarez and Puerto Quijarro); 1 autonomous indigenous government (Indigenous Autonomous Government of Charagua), and 5 protected areas (3 nationals, 1 municipal and 1 indigenous), in the development of management capacities for the prevention and control of forest fires, protecting at the same the biodiversity in the territory of the Great Chaco-Pantanal Conservation Landscape, in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia.",

Increased technical and financial viability of EDM, due to reduced system losses, and increased revenues from productive uses of electricity in the project area.The target group is the population in northern Inhambane and southern Sofala province, which is mainly rural with villages/smaller communities located along the main highways, where also the major part of the planned transmission line will go. 54% of the population consists of women, mainly depending on small-scale agriculture and fisheries as well as trade. The industrial sector is confined to a petrochemical industry and natural gas extraction. Today, 19% of residents in the province have access to electricity (2016), which is lower than the average for the country (26%). The planned intervention will target all households (both cement and mud houses), businesses, and institutions such as schools and health centres. In addition, close to 1,400 street lights will be installed. The clients will be offered different solutions such as ready boards which is a simpler solution. In total, it is estimated that approximately 95,000 inhabitants will have access to reliable electricity by project-end. By 2030, it is estimated that the number has been doubled.The proposed intervention will be implemented in 2018-2022, with main activities in 2019-2020. The GoM has for this requested Sida through the Embassy of Sweden in Maputo to support with a total of SEK 329 million. This relates to; costs for construction (transmission: 132 MSEK; substations: 115 MSEK; distribution including connection of new customers: SEK 64 million); costs for the Clients Representative (Hifab) of 14 MSEK; and costs for LED-lights and contingency assessed to 4 MSEK. Sida also estimates that a total of SEK 6 million should be earmarked for Sidas costs for monitoring consultant and different evaluations that may be necessary. GoM through EDM will bear the costs of its own project implementation team, as well as compensation costs to the local population for compensation of right-of-way.

Today, 19% of residents in the province have access to electricity (2016), which is lower than the average for the country (26%). The planned intervention will target all households (both cement and mud houses), businesses, and institutions such as schools and health centres. In addition, close to 1,400 street lights will be installed. The clients will be offered different solutions such as ready boards which is a simpler solution. In total, it is estimated that approximately 95,000 inhabitants will have access to reliable electricity by project-end. By 2030, it is estimated that the number has been doubled.The proposed intervention will be implemented in 2018-2022, with main activities in 2019-2020. The GoM has for this requested Sida through the Embassy of Sweden in Maputo to support with a total of SEK 329 million. This relates to; costs for construction (transmission: 132 MSEK; substations: 115 MSEK; distribution including connection of new customers: SEK 64 million); costs for the Clients Representative (Hifab) of 14 MSEK; and costs for LED-lights and contingency assessed to 4 MSEK. Sida also estimates that a total of SEK 6 million should be earmarked for Sidas costs for monitoring consultant and different evaluations that may be necessary. GoM through EDM will bear the costs of its own project implementation team, as well as compensation costs to the local population for compensation of right-of-way. Compensation costs have been estimated by EDM to a total of 36 MSEK.",

Achievement of this objective would contribute to increased womenâ€™s economic empowerment in Mozambique by identifying, catalysing and scaling up systemic solutions that benefit low-income women, which is the overall goal of the programme.\r\nUsing a gender-transformative approach, WIN programme will seek multiple ways to increase womenâ€™s economic empowerment with solutions covering increase of business revenue or wages, reduce the cost of doing business / working, reduce womenâ€™s unpaid work and/or improve access to services, such as financial services,Â to wholesale supply / distribution, to Management tools and information Rules and norms around womenâ€™s entrepreneurship.\r\nGiven that most low-income women in Mozambique are operating micro or small businesses, a priority target group for WIN is women-owned businesses in markets with high growth potential. Instead of women-led business, women who own their businesses can benefit more easily from a program that targets business performance, as they have more direct control over the resulting business income increases. The program will also look for opportunities to benefit women as customers, managers and staff.",

            "Description": "The We Effect NACE subprogram follows the AGIR II programme mission which is â€œTo contribute to the emergence of an active, strong and vibrant civil society in Mozambique, who legitimately raise and channel the voice of the female and male right holders who are at present being politically, socially and economically marginalized, secure their access to all information they need to exercise their civil rights, and effectively participating in and influencing the course of policy decision-making process and accountability of the duty bearers for a transparent, democratic, inclusive, gender just and human rights sensitive governance.â€; and AGIR vision of â€œTo contribute to a Mozambican society where its citizens, particularly also presently marginalized groups, fully enjoy their rights to inclusion and equity, to retribution of wealth created from the countryâ€™s patrimony, to accessible and affordable public services of good quality, to basic civil freedoms and to political representation and participation, in a peaceful and ecologically sustainable environment.â€  In this regard, We Effect aims as ultimate impact that rights-holders living in the rural and urban areas have secured benefits from use of land and natural resources, enjoy safe and healthy environment and reduced negative climate change impact.  The AGIR II NACE impact objective is \"Secured benefits for rights-holders from use of land and natural resources, enjoy safe and healthy environment and reduced negative climate change impact\". That will be reached through: 1 Empowered partner organisations that support the rights of people in poverty to land, secure land tenure, and sustainable management of natural Resources; 2. Empowered farmer organisations defending the right of everyone to safe and nourishing food in accordance with the right to a balanced diet and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger; 3. Empowered partner organisations defending the right of people to a safe and healthy environment in ecological balance, today and for future generations; and 4. Empowered partner organisations using study circles as a method to achieve thematic results. All above in correspondence with the Theory of Change that aims to empower local communities to be able make actions towards the reduction of poverty and the development of a just society.\r\nWe Effect - AGIRÂ NACE Cost Extension objectives (2021-2022)\r\nThe cost extension will allow We Effect and selected partner organisations to strengthen and consolidate the results and achievement made during AGIR I and II.Â \r\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, some activities could not be concluded, including the consolidation of results and finalising the collection of lessons learned and success stories from the six year programme. The pandemic and the resulting Government social restrictions meant that We Effect could not ensure a sustainable phase out of the AGIR II programme, the largest ever civil society programme in the country. The cost extension will allow We Effect and five seleted partner organisations to conclude pending activities and consolidate the results achieved.\r\nThe cost extension will be focused on two main areas: (i) the right to land and (ii) the right to food.\r\nThe two thematic areas are two main priority areas in the \"Vi Agroforestry & We Effect Interim Strategy 2020-2022\" (https://viskogen.se/app/uploads/2021/05/gov-1177-v.2.0-vi-agroforestry-we-effect-interim-strategy-2020-2022.pdf), as is climate resilience with gender equality which also relevant to the national priorities. Both thematic areas were part of the natural resourcesâ€™ subprogramÂ of the AGIR-NACE and where there has been considerable progress, both in capacity building and results.Â \r\nGeographically,Â AGIR-NACE cost extension will be implemented in four provinces: Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Tete and Maputo. Niassa and Tete provinces were selected to support local partners to empower local rights holders whose rights to land and food are essential for their survival. Cabo Delgado Province was selected to support the local partner who is assisting communities whose rights to life, shelter, food, and land are threatened by the ongoing conflict. It was also selected to contribute to peace building support to the affected population. Maputo, the Capital, is the decision-making centre. Partners based in Maputo will continue to undertake advocacy for improving policies on behalf and together with the rights holders.\r\nIn the beginning of 2020, the Government of Mozambique - GoM, has launched the consultation process to revise the land policy. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic the consultations were notÂ  carried out as planned, limited transparency and participatory approaches were used by the GoM to conduct the consultations.Â Â The cost extension will supportÂ  partners organizations to actively participate in the land policy revision process, towards ensuring the protection of small farmers,Â  especially the womenâ€™s rights to land in Mozambique by improving a process that protects womenâ€™s right to land and reduces land conflicts.\r\nFor this cost extension, the IPOs have agreed on six specific criterias that guide the selection of partners. The criteria are partners that: i) have been a core or project partner in the AGIR programme between 2015-2020; ii) work in thematic area/s relevant to AGIR and the current national context; iii)have received an unqualified audit opinion in the 2020 audit report; iv)have no corruption incident reported during the implementation of the AGIR programme; v) have good programme management capacity and sound internal control systems; and vi) have the potential to deliver on the peace building and nexus, where possible.\r\nExpected result'sÂ (from annex 1Â Results Framework, July 2021 â€“ June 2022 )\r\nWith this cost extension period itÂ is expected a properÂ consolidation ofÂ  NACEÂ results (on rightÂ to land and ritgh to food areas), collection of lessons learned and success stories from the six year programme as well as a closure of the prgramme onÂ a responsibleÂ way.Â \r\nOnÂ Right to Land: (Empowered the partner organisations that support the rightsÂ of people in poverty to land, secure land tenure, and sustainable management of natural resources) the activities willÂ focus on:\r\n- Improved policies on land and natural resources\r\n- Increased community awareness of their right to land and natural resources\r\nOn rightÂ to food: (Empowered the farmer organisations defending the right of everyone to safe and nourishing food in accordance with the right to a balanced diet and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger) the activities focus on:Â \r\n- Improved policies for small scale farmers and their right to food\r\n- Increased community knowledge on better nutrition, agricultural production and right to food\r\nThe Embassy assess that by focusing on two specific areas and selected POs,Â Â it will allow better and rational application of Sida funds to be allocated to the 5Â POs as well as assure responsible closing of the programme.",

            "Description": "The project â€œSOCREMO Guarantee for MSE & Women Owned Businesses 2014-2020â€ is a cooperation between Sida, USAID and Socremo. The project supports the establishment of  a Loan Portfolio Guarantee (LPG) of ten million USD by Socremo that will enable 4.000 micro, small and women owned enterprises in Mozambique get access to credit. The focus is on informal, female (at least 2000 women-owned businesses) and rural-based enterprises (at least 50% of MSEs located outside Maputo city). \r\nAccess to credit is expected to enable the enterprises to expand their business and thus generate incomes and jobs. There is an expectation that Socremo continues to lend to this segment post-guarantee, that the project is able to demonstrate that lending to this segment can be commercially viable and that the success of this guarantee could incentivize banks and microfinance institutions to lower their collateral requirements. It is also expected that the enterprises â€“ with a positive credit history - will have increased the likelihood of getting access to credit post-guarantee.\r\n\r\nSida has therefore decided to complement the guarantee with two assignments, one M&E assignment and one Technical Assistance assignment for the borrowers and for Socremo. Both of these will be funded by Sida. The M/E assignment will establish a system that monitors the results that the guarantee aims to fulfil and the TA assignment will build capacity in specified areas important for the 4000 borrowers to be able to become more bankable post-guarantee and identified capacity needs at Socremo/staff, for instance in the development of new financial products that are tailored for the new segment.\r\n\r\nThe result of the consultancy on the design of the technical assistance (TA) to borrowers and Socremo as well as of its monitoring evaluation held in 2015 concluded that the technical package on the borrowers should focus on a) building a cadre of qualified mentors and link them as resource people and supporters to Socremo clients whose businesses have the potential to grow; b) sensitizing the general public in select areas about the importance of womenâ€™s entrepreneurship, along with some basic concepts in entrepreneurship; and c) building the capacity and strength of several womenâ€™s business organizations to better serve their members. In the M&E side the conclusion was as most indicators that would help measure the impact of the LGP are collected already by Socremo, Sida could hire an outside firm to collect additional business-level indicators that would help understand business-level impacts while sector-level impacts should not be collected by Socremo. \r\n\r\nFollowing the result of the consultancy, the Embassy of Sweden intends to procure consultancy services for the implementation of 1) TA to borrowers and 2) M&E of the guarantee beneficiaries. The present decision refers to the procurement of the TA provider that will develop and implement training package for the Socremo guarantee beneficiaries who want to receive it. The training package to guarantee beneficiaries  should focus on two things: (i) Skills (writing better business plans, better credit applications), and (ii) How to make maximum use of the financial track-record that they will build up over time with the relationship with Socremo. This could also include mentoring and couching of the most promising entrepreneurs.",

            "Description": "The contribution is an additional support to the implementation of Tanzaniaâ€™s Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) program which aim at the poorest segment of the population. The additional financing is motivated by good results achieved so far, by a collaboration that works well, by an existing financing gap and by desirability to increase the incentive for Tanzania to contribute to the programme to a larger extent. The assessment that was made to underpin the decision on support in March 2016 is still largely valid. The program is nationwide and targets approximately one million households identified as extremely poor. Every two month households receive a fixed cash transfer that is adjusted to the household size. In addition to the fixed contribution, households can also receive an additional transfer that is conditional on children attending school and small children brought on regular visits to primary health care centres. PSSN also includes a public works component. During the agricultural lean season, when it is difficult to find temporary jobs, labour-intensive projects that in various ways contribute to the local communitiesâ€™ development are implemented (e.g. construction of class rooms and dams for irrigation). Only people belonging to the poorest households, i.e. those who are also eligible for the direct cash transfers, are eligible to participate in the public works projects.By design PSSN empowers women. The payment of both cash contributions and compensation for participation in public works are made to an adult woman in the household. Only in households where there is no adult woman the payment can be made to a man. In addition to the direct cash transfers and public works components, PSSN includes a livelihood component to help households develop productive activities in order to eventually be able to graduate from poverty.The Tanzanian government represented by the Ministry of Finance and Planning is Swedenâ€™s agreement partner. Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), under the President's Office, is the implementing authority. Sweden's contribution will be deposited in a program account at the Bank of Tanzania as will the contributions from the World Bank and DFID. Tanzania, represented by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, is formally responsible for ensuring that the Swedish contribution is used for intended purposes. TASAF uses the money in the program account to implement PSSN in accordance with agreed annual work-plans and budgets. PSSNâ€™s National Steering Committee, with representatives from both the public and private sector, is responsible for the strategic management of the program and decides on annual plans and budgets. TASAF and its director is responsible to the NSC, and have overall responsibility for program implementation and monitoring. TASAF implements the program in villages and urban wards through regional and local level government authorities. TASAF is part of the Tanzanian Government and is organisationally located under the Presidentâ€™s Office.Sweden's share of the total budget represents 21 percent during the financial years 2017/2018-2019/2020. The World Bank, DFID and Sweden all contribute significant amounts to the programme. There are some uncertainty regarding the financing during period for the additional Swedish financing. The World Bank is expected to decide on yet another additional financing and Sweden will then most likely be the second largest donor after World Bank during the period. This will increase Swedenâ€™s weight in the dialogue and the possibility to influence. Other donors development partners contributing to PSSN include UN, USAID, Irish Aid and Bill and Melinda Gates Fundation.

The intervention seeks to achieve sustainable results over time and disseminate good practices of the current \"Territorial Rural Economic Development Project\" PRODERT, in order for the market systems to work more effectively and inclusively in favour of the poor, as well as to increase the number of beneficiaries with potential to increase income and participate in market systems (from 7,500 to 26,750 direct beneficiaries), and increasing geographical coverage from 16 to 27 municipalities in the Departments of Huehuetenango, San Marcos, TotonicapÃ¡n, QuichÃ© and Quetzaltenango. During this phase the project is expected to develop complementary alliances with potential market partners to support innovations in order to increase scale, scope and to strengthen the target groups response capacity, sustainability and resilience. According to Helvetas, due to the positive results of the previous phases of PRODERT, there is an imminent interest in the selected communities where the population has expressed strong interest to participate in the project. Until now, it has not been possible to incorporate them due to lack of funds.Â´Based on a previous MSD/M4P analysis, main identified constrains of the target groups to be part of the market systems are: (i) to reach a good level of associativity, (ii) lack of inclusive financial services (iii) lack of technical assistance and (iv) business development. In collaboration with different public, private and civil society actors the project with a catalyst role is expected to facilitate systemic changes in the identified constraints and Helvetas will focus on overcome these barriers. Preliminarily the intervention will support the development of 6 viable value chains with market potential and scaling up: potatoes, coffee, vegetables, handicrafts, beekeeping and sheep.\r\n\r\nPRODERT Scaling up amounts SEK 79 800 000, for the period 2018 â€“ 2021. Besides, as part of this intervention it is estimated that the Department of Loans and Guarantees at Sida Headquarter (HQ) will support a guarantee and capital risk instrument, the cost of the guarantee is not still defined. A mission from the Sida HQ visited Guatemala in October 2017 to start assessing this specific support.",

The request amounts to SEK 20 000 000 per year for five years, for a total of SEK 100 000 000 over the period 2018-2022. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the programme is to \"dramatically scale-up the recognition of the land and resource rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and women across the developing world and improve their livelihoods.\" \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of the programme can be summarised as follows: \r\n1.

It also provides small grants to partners and initiatives that operates at national and local level in the countries where RRI has collaboration. \r\n\r\nSida has received a request for support to: \"From risk and conflict to peace and prosperity: Securing indigenous peoples', communities and women's land and forest rights to confront climate change and advance sustainable development, security and wellbeing for all\", which is the strategic programme of RRI during 2018-2022. The request amounts to SEK 20 000 000 per year for five years, for a total of SEK 100 000 000 over the period 2018-2022. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the programme is to \"dramatically scale-up the recognition of the land and resource rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and women across the developing world and improve their livelihoods.\" \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of the programme can be summarised as follows: \r\n1. Indigenous peoples, local communities and women are empowered and have more secure tenure rights to land and other natural resources \r\n2. Governments support this and scale-up legal recognition and enforcement \r\n3. Companies and investors adopt standards and rights-based approaches recognizing local tenure rights\r\n\r\nThe amount of SEK 20 million per year 2018-2021 from Sida would constitute 20 % of the aspired total budget for the period. It implies a 70-100 % increase of the funding agreed to by Sida for 2013-2017, which initially was SEK 50 million (in 2016 reduced to SEK 44 million due to the refugee crisis in Sweden). The proposed contribution constitutes a larger share of the total than before, but considered to still be at an acceptable level.\r\n\r\nSida has provided core-support to RRI since 2008, when the coalition was newly established. The increased support by Sida is motivated by the relevance of the programme proposed, and by positive experiences from previous cooperation. It is assessed likely that RRI will be able to implement the proposal in an effective and cost-efficient way. It is also assessed that RRI would have capacity, if funding alloes, to expand the provision of small grants in direct support of partners at country and local level.\r\n\r\nDue to a changing political context, some of the previous donors to RRI have significantly reduced or ended financing to RRI. UK is likely to continue but reduce the grant. Continued commitment is also likely from Ford Foundation, WellSpring and Norway. A long-term commitment from Sida at an early stage will provide better conditions for long-term planning and recruitment of senior professionals by RRI.

The TF aims to secure land and forest rights for Indigenous peoples and local communities in the developing world by providing project support to the communities, civil society, and to some extent to governments. Government support and involvement is always required for a project to be accepted.  This proposed intervention will be the first considerable direct support to this new organization. It has approximately the same annual amount as the previous phase, that was channeled through RRI. Thus far, it has received direct funding from the Ford Foundation, 3 MUSD in 2017 and 2018.Access to land and natural resources for rural poor is often based on customary tenure, which tends to be insecure due to a lack of political, legal and administrative recognition, and contradictions between the formal and informal systems. This leads to a situation of insecurity for these local communities that affects most aspects of life, such as access to and/or security of livelyhoods, including food, water, housing and source of income, political rights to participate in processes that concern the land you live on and the land you have used for generations, the social rights and traditions that relate to the community; how you take decisions, plan your production, etcetera. Collective tenure is often not considered in the legal systems, and insecure collective tenure often concerns forest. Therefore, both RRI and the TF have a focus on forest lands, although grazelands and agricultural lands also can be considered for support. Fortunately, the global advocacy over the last decades - by RRI and others - for the political and legal recognition of communal land rights for indigenous peoples (IPs) and local communities have resulted in considerable advances and adapted legal frameworks in many countries. However, all this leeway did not give secure tenure on the ground, since there is a void in implementation and in administrative recognition.  The lack of implementation should not automatically be interpreted as a lack of political will or of resources â€“ but often a lack of capacity, information and experience.

It has approximately the same annual amount as the previous phase, that was channeled through RRI. Thus far, it has received direct funding from the Ford Foundation, 3 MUSD in 2017 and 2018.Access to land and natural resources for rural poor is often based on customary tenure, which tends to be insecure due to a lack of political, legal and administrative recognition, and contradictions between the formal and informal systems. This leads to a situation of insecurity for these local communities that affects most aspects of life, such as access to and/or security of livelyhoods, including food, water, housing and source of income, political rights to participate in processes that concern the land you live on and the land you have used for generations, the social rights and traditions that relate to the community; how you take decisions, plan your production, etcetera. Collective tenure is often not considered in the legal systems, and insecure collective tenure often concerns forest. Therefore, both RRI and the TF have a focus on forest lands, although grazelands and agricultural lands also can be considered for support. Fortunately, the global advocacy over the last decades - by RRI and others - for the political and legal recognition of communal land rights for indigenous peoples (IPs) and local communities have resulted in considerable advances and adapted legal frameworks in many countries. However, all this leeway did not give secure tenure on the ground, since there is a void in implementation and in administrative recognition.  The lack of implementation should not automatically be interpreted as a lack of political will or of resources â€“ but often a lack of capacity, information and experience. It is a new field of work for government administration as well as for NGOs and communities. RRI concluded that a special focus on the practical aspects of implementation was needed. The TF offers the following kinds of support:Scale up implementation of land and forest tenure reform policies and legislation by:â€“ Providing support to establish legitimate tenure rights in areas where traditional communal rights are not formally recognizedâ€“ Providing support for community mapping, demarcation, and registration effortsâ€“ Strengthening the capacity of national organizations to provide land tenure related services to reach disadvantaged and vulnerable groups Enable governments and communities to test new models, strategies and approaches by:â€“ Testing practical solutions to implementation challengesâ€“ Assisting governments and communities to overcome administrative obstacles to land rights recognition and titlingâ€“ Building capacity of government agencies responsible for titling and protecting indigenous and community rights",

This leads to a situation of insecurity for these local communities that affects most aspects of life, such as access to and/or security of livelyhoods, including food, water, housing and source of income, political rights to participate in processes that concern the land you live on and the land you have used for generations, the social rights and traditions that relate to the community; how you take decisions, plan your production, etcetera. Collective tenure is often not considered in the legal systems, and insecure collective tenure often concerns forest. Therefore, both RRI and the TF have a focus on forest lands, although grazelands and agricultural lands also can be considered for support. Fortunately, the global advocacy over the last decades - by RRI and others - for the political and legal recognition of communal land rights for indigenous peoples (IPs) and local communities have resulted in considerable advances and adapted legal frameworks in many countries. However, all this leeway did not give secure tenure on the ground, since there is a void in implementation and in administrative recognition.  The lack of implementation should not automatically be interpreted as a lack of political will or of resources â€“ but often a lack of capacity, information and experience. It is a new field of work for government administration as well as for NGOs and communities. RRI concluded that a special focus on the practical aspects of implementation was needed. The TF offers the following kinds of support:Scale up implementation of land and forest tenure reform policies and legislation by:â€“ Providing support to establish legitimate tenure rights in areas where traditional communal rights are not formally recognizedâ€“ Providing support for community mapping, demarcation, and registration effortsâ€“ Strengthening the capacity of national organizations to provide land tenure related services to reach disadvantaged and vulnerable groups Enable governments and communities to test new models, strategies and approaches by:â€“ Testing practical solutions to implementation challengesâ€“ Assisting governments and communities to overcome administrative obstacles to land rights recognition and titlingâ€“ Building capacity of government agencies responsible for titling and protecting indigenous and community rights",

At the IAF, we support community-led approaches to creating economic opportunity and fostering womenâ€™s empowerment. The AsociaciÃ³n de Mujeres RÃ­o Isquizal (AMRIS) is an association of Mam Indigenous women that has developed a solidarity network in 15 communities across the municipality of San Sebastian Huehuetenango. In this grant, AMRIS will strengthen food security at the household level and increase womenâ€™s incomes by providing training, technical assistance, and access to credit for raising livestock and planting fruit trees. This will ultimately cultivate resilience in their families and communities, and address factors that drive many to migrate from this high-sending region. AMRIS will also develop womenâ€™s leadership skills through workshops on leadership, human rights, civic participation, gender, health, and nutrition. This grant is part of the IAF's efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration in Central America and part of the IAFâ€™s Women INvesting in Growth and Security (WINGS) initiative to empower women as business and community leaders..",

More specifically, this includes El Salvador has among the highest levels of internal displacement in Latin America driven by criminal gangsâ€™ threats, extortions, and assassinations. This internal displacement is often a precursor to U.S.-bound irregular migration if internal migrants are unable to find safety elsewhere within the country. At the IAF, we support community-led approaches to enhance peace and security. In five municipalities in El Salvador and one in Honduras, our grantee partner Cristosal works with local organizations and municipal authorities to strengthen systems of protection and development for internally displaced persons and ensure that they can exercise their rights as citizens in their own countries. Cristosal is building the capacity of local stakeholders, involving internally displaced persons in the development activities of participating municipalities, carrying out exchanges between organizations, and documenting best practices. This grant is part of the IAF's efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration in Central America..",

In addition, this award Farmers are often absent from discussions about how policies and programs impact sustainable agricultural production. At the IAF, we are investing in a regional effort, in conjunction with the University of British Columbia that will give voice to farmers and directly support them in collecting, analyzing, and presenting data that they can incorporate into their operations to manage their farms more efficiently. FundaciÃ³n para el Desarrollo SocioeconÃ³mico y RestauraciÃ³n Ambiental (FUNDESYRAM) established the first participatory certification system in El Salvador. It also connects producers directly to consumers to improve farmersâ€™ quality of life and consumersâ€™ food security. Finally, FUNDESYRAM creates spaces for dialogue among producer organizations, indigenous communities, government agencies, and the private sector about policies and programs to promote sustainable agriculture. The results of this regional project will inform agricultural support organizations (government extension experts, farmer groups) and policy-makers with context-specific data about how to encourage the transition to sustainable agricultural practices to improve food security, enhance farmer livelihoods, and minimize environmental degradation. This is part of the IAFâ€™s strategic initiative for sustainable agriculture..",
